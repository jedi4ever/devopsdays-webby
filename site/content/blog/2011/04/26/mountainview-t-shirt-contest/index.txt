For the upcoming [DevopsDays in Mountain View](/events/2011-mountainview) we're looking to create t-shirts based off of your design.  We're going to run a design submission period, followed by a brief rating period.  The design with the most votes will get printed on the back of the DevopsDays 2011 - Mountain View event shirt.  How cool is that?

## Details
In order to make the voting period safe, we'll be collecting submissions up to Midnight PDT on May 15th.  Once we have all submissions we'll create the voting apparatus at DevopsDays.org - where interested people can vote on their favorite design.  We will close the design voting period out at Midnight PDT on May 31st - and give the design to our printer.

Note, based on feedback from previous events we're going to go with black/dark-colored t-shirts.  Please ensure your designs accommodate.

## Submit an Idea
Even if you're not a great artist, you can still think of a great tagline !
