Devopsday USA 2010 will be held in&#160;<strong>Mountain View, California on Friday, June 25, 2010</strong>.&#160;This event is inspired by and a continuation of the conversation from&#160;<a href="/events/2009-ghent/program">Devopsdays Belgium 2009</a>
<br>
As we put together an agenda, we are looking to *YOU* to help shape the event.
<br>
The best way to ensure that you get the most out of this event is to make a proposal or suggestion about a topic in which you are interested!
