[DevopsDays](/) events have always been run on a _non-profit_ bases. And we've done great so far....

But with your help we can make it more awesome!

In a nutshell: **this website needs some serious pimping**

- We would like to make this site a place where people announce their own devops events and post back their videos/talks
- Better expose and structure the talks and videos we record from all the events
- A graphical overhaul (I admit I'm color-blind, doh)

This is where you as a sponsor come in: help us raise the money to hire a professional designer

In return we will give you:

- our eternal gratitude (but that doesn't buy you much, does it :)
- your logo on the frontpage of the website + visible on each of the individual events pages
- a free entrance ticket for all the events organized in the future

In the name of the community, a big thank you! Now [blow me away with your offer](mailto:info@devopsdays.org?subject=sitesponsoring)!
