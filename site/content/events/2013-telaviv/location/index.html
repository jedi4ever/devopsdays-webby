### [Google Campus Tel Aviv](http://www.campustelaviv.com)

Electra Tower, 26th Floor
98 Yigal Alon st. 
Tel Aviv 

### Arrival and parking

We highly recommend getting there by train, it's a 10-minute walk from HaShalom train station. If you're driving, there are a few paid parking lots around the venue - there's one under Electra tower (quite pricey), one in HaSolelim st. and probably a few more that are not listed here. There are also parking spots in the neighboring streets. Unfortunately there's no free parking arrangement (it's a free conference after allâ€¦)
