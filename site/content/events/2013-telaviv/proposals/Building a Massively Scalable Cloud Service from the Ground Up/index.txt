title: "Building a Massively Scalable Cloud Service from the Ground Up"
---

**Abstract:**
 
Serving developer binaries isn’t trivial. Such binaries are consumed by tools ,and create massive request load. Add to that support for metadata, REST API, storage quotas, stats, repo indexes on demand and global HA distribution, and you’ve got yourself a pretty complicated system to run and manage. This talk will show you how Bintray, JFrog’s social binary distribution service, works. We will speak about how the system segmentation supports massive loads across data centers with stateless vertical scaling; how Grails applications scale and how we tie up different NoSQL technologies such as CouchDB, MongoDB, ElasticSearch & Redis; how we chose between physical and virtual servers and how we manage deployments without service interruption.
