title: "Test automation patterns for continuous delivery"
---

**Abstract:**
 
The heart of every continuous delivery process is test automation. It is the test automation that gains us the confidence in releasing software frequently. In this talk, we will share test automation patterns, which we implemented in our team CD pipelines. Examples are happy paths, test grids, data subsets, parallel test execution, testing async tasks, load / capacity testing and more.
