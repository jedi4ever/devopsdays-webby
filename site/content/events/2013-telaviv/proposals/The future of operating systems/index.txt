title: "The future of operating systems"
---

**Abstract:**
 
Linux distros and Windows NT both date back to 1993 and the principles of the operating systems we use today are rooted in that era. The way we use O/S and software has changed dramatically since, and the role of O/S has shifted considerably, giving birth to many tools trying to bridge the gap. This talk will cover the evolution of O/S in recent years and emerging trends which may prevail in the near future. 

**Speaker:**

Avishai Ish-Shalom, [FewBytes](http://www.fewbytes.com)

Avishai is a veteran ops and a survivor of many prod skirmishes. Currently masquerading as the CTO of Fewbytes - a consulting company for Ops and architecture.
