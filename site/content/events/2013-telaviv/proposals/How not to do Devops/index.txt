title: "How not to do Devops: Confessions of a Thought Leader"
---

**Abstract:**
 
At every conference I go to, and as a member of the core Devopsdays team, I see a lot of proposals too, it seems that 99% of talks are of the sort: ""I did this awesome thing - you should too!"" or ""This is awesome - you should try it!"".  However the reality for experienced people is more often ""I tried this, and messed up badly - here's what I learned, and how you can avoid the pain I suffered"".

I've been a Devops practitioner, activist, enthusiast and consultant since day one.  I keynoted at the second ever Devopsdays.  And I've run a consulting firm specialising in Devops ideas for 7 years.  That means I've made a *ton* of mistakes.  Many of them painful and costly.

In this talk I will bare my soul - tell you all about the terrible mistakes I've made, and explore lessons learned, so we can all learn from the things I've done wrong.
