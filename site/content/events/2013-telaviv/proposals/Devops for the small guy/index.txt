title: "Devops for the small guy"
---

**Abstract:**
 
Sometimes DevOps might be an overkill and PaaS (Platform as a Service) the solution.
In this talk we will see what happens in the world of small companies and startups and how one can survive without dedicated DevOps, using existing Managed-Hosting solutions (PaaS)
We will discuss some real world use cases of companies using Heroku, the various add-ons used, monitoring, scaling, deployment, pros, cons and pricing, and speak about when PaaS is no longer a good fit.

**Speaker:**

Boris Dinkevich, Partner at [500tech](http://www.500tech.com)

Boris was a DevOps ("IT Architect" back then) in the Israeli Air Force, and now the owner of Rails development shop.
