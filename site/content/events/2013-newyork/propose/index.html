<center><b>Call for proposals closes at midnight NYC time on September 1, 2013. </b></center>
<hr>
There are three ways to propose a session:
<ol>
  <li><strong><em>A proposal for a talk/panel</em></strong> during the conference part : these are 30 minutes slots that will have all people's full attention as everybody will be in the one room.</li>
  <li><strong><em>An Ignite talk</em></strong> that will be presented during the<a href="/pages/ignite-talks-format"> Ignite sessions</a>: these are 5 minutes slots with slides changing every 15 seconds (20 slides total) also presented to all attendees in one room.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Openspace session</em></strong>: even without a prepared presentation we welcome the discussion and interaction by having people propose a session on the fly during the openspace opening. Check the <a href="/pages/open-space-format">openspace format</a> for more information.
</ol>

### Even if you don't propose, please consider [commenting on proposals submitted by others](../proposals/)

Our main criteria to make it to the top selection are:

- _original content_: content not yet presented at other conferences, or a new angle to an existing problem
- _new presenters_: people who are new to the space and have insightful stuff to tell, we want to hear everbody's voice. <strong>If you've presented a 30-minute talks at any Devopsdays in the last 2 years, we encourage you to submit an ignite talk or conduct an openspace session. In addition, please consider encourage other speakers to submit proposals!</strong>
- _no vendor pitches_: as much as we value vendors and sponsors, we just don't think this is the right forum. There is a demo openspace slot where you have 5 minutes to show products.

<strong>Note: proposals will be anonymized prior to evaluation. Please do not include any information that can be used to identify you (e.g., links to your blog items, mentions of your company, etc.)</strong>

<strong>Some suggestions to get you thinking:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Reports from the frontlines: what worked (and didn't) while implementing Devops in your organization?</li>
	<li>Devops at scale / in the Enterprise</li>
	<li>Applying Devops principles beyond the tech organization (e.g., HR, Finance, etc.)</li>
	<li>Devops, Lean, Agile: what's shared and what's unique?</li>
	<li>And of course any other topic in the realm of Devops</li>
</ul>

<strong>How to make a proposal:</strong> Send an email to [<a href="mailto:proposals-nyc-2013@devopsdays.org">proposals-nyc-2013@devopsdays.org</a>] with the following information:
<ol>
	<li>Proposal working title (can be changed later)</li>
	<li>Type (presentation, panel discussion, moderated general discussion, debate, etc.,ignite)</li>
	<li>Description or abstract</li>
</ol>

<strong>Rules:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Be specific... we aren't mind readers (a description of about 20 lines is about right)</li>
	<li>Detail is good... but not as important as explaining why your proposal would be interesting</li>
	<li><strong>Nominations welcome</strong>... if you know someone who has content/experience relevant to the DevOps conversation, please point us in their direction!</li>
	<li>No tool talks if tools are not open-source or generally commerically available</li>
	<li>Multiple proposals welcome... just follow the other rules</li>
</ul>
