title: "Teaching an old developer new DevOps tricks"
---

**Abstract:**

I confess -- I was a developer...in enterprise software.  We released
software only occasionally.  We threw release candidates over the wall
to QA.  Deployment and operations was the customers’ problem.  From
such a background, joining a DevOps team is an eye-opening experience.
 But I am proof that you can teach an old enterprise software
developer new DevOps tricks.

Across the industry, the number of DevOps teams is growing.  The
number of experienced DevOps engineers is increasing, but at a much
slower rate.  To fill DevOps roles, it will be increasingly necessary
to transition experienced engineers to the new way of thinking.

I will give advice for developers looking to make the smooth
transition to the world of devops.  This advice will also help devops
teams integrate people from traditional development backgrounds.
