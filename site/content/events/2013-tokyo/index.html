Do you have know a nice location near the target location? Or is your company interested in hosting the event?  [Send an email to the organizers](mailto:<%= render(:partial => "/#{@eventhome}/_email_organizers") %>).

Once date and location have been decided we will open the [call for proposals](propose) and registration.
