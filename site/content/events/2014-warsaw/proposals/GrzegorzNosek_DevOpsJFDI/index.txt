**Abstract:**

Are your servers still unique snowflakes, managed by hand and an occasional shell script? No two development environments
alike? Whatever your excuse for passing on configuration management, I've probably been there. 

**Speaker:**

Co-founder and Chief Tinkering Officer at MegiTeam, an innovative web host. Long-time Linux admin and systems programmer.
Lazy to the bone, automates anything he has to do more than twice.
