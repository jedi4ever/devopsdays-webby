**Abstract:**

What if your cooperate network infrastructure consists out of topological islands which aren’t connected permanently to
the internet? How do you handle data synchronization among data centers if bandwidth is changing all the time? How do
you deploy your applications in such an environment and how do you manage application monitoring? Is it possible to use
cloud services, SaaS, IaaS and so on in such a setup and how to manage it? What is necessary to handle video data,
images and other documents and keep everything in sync. Join us to learn how we use Docker, Chef, AWS and friends in
such an unusual business case.

**Speaker:**

Joern has been developing, debugging and designing software for more than ten years. At kreuzwerker he is responsible
for architecture, new technologies and concepts. A computer science graduate, his professional interest is in the use of
functional programming languages and the architecture of distributed applications. In his diverse projects he has
gained solid experience with operating systems (primarily Linux and Mac OS) and has created various databases from
different paradigms. He masters C, Ruby, Java, Erlang and a little JVM LISP. He is thus as much at home in
infrastructure and service clouds (preferably AWS) as on the 
command line.
