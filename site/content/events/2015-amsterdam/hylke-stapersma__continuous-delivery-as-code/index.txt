title: "Continuous delivery as code"
---

**Abstract:**

When you are building software it is important that you have a factory floor equipped with the right tools and machines to build a particular version of your software. This is similar to building a car.

You are unable to build a T-Ford in a modern Ford factory. This means that your factory floor (continuous delivery pipeline) has to evolve with every version of your software.

In this workshop you will learn how to facilitate the evolution of your continuous delivery pipeline. You will learn how to build such a pipeline within Jenkins using open-source plugins and how this pipeline can be versioned within your source code. During the workshop a complete continuous delivery pipeline will be build from scratch.

This includes important steps like testing puppet code with docker and rspec, functional testing and deploying.


**Speaker:**

Hylke is a software craftsman who is working as a consultant for codecentric and he is a contributor and maintainer of a small number of open-source projects.

He is passionate about sharing ideas and knowledge on everything related to software development and delivery.
