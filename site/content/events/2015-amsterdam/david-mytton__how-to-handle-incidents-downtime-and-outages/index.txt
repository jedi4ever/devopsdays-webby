title: "How to handle incidents, downtime and outages"
---

**Abstract:**

"100% uptime is impossible. Modern architectures are designed around failure but what does that mean for the human aspect of incident management? This talk will consider how to prepare for outages, how to structure the response, and how those experiences and techniques differ for small and large companies.

Key topics will include:

* On call - rotations, scheduling, systems and policies
* Preparing for downtime - teams, systems and product architecture
* Documentation
* Checklists and playbooks
* How we actually handle incidents
* Post mortems"
