**Abstract:**

Before launching your new app you would better be in control of your environments: develop & test in a production-like environment and automate the whole enchilada using Ansible & Vagrant.

Bassie will show how to set up a disposable development environment that mimics your production servers in a re-usable way with minimal maintenance.

**Speaker:**

Bassie is a software developer & system engineer with decades wasted on late-night hacking. While born before the epoch he has a keen eye for new technologies. At the moment he is engaged with a major Dutch bank and an established European identity & access management cloud service.
