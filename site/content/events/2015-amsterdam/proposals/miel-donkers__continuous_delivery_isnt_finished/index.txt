title: "Continuous Delivery isn't Finished"
---

**Abstract:**

Continuous Delivery is focussing mostly on deploying services (software) to production, so that they can be used by the customer. But we think that's not where the role of Continuous Delivery ends. Keeping these services running in production is just as important. Therefore making sure that monitoring is in place and the possibility to take evasive measures belongs to the process of continuous delivery.
We would like to discuss what we think is necessary to take the next steps, and show some examples on how this can be arranged.
