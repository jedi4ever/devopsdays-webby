**Abstract:**

What does it really mean to be Agile? Following an ‘Agile process’ like Scrum, Kanban or SAFe is just one step. While transforming to an Agile organization we also expect people to be Agile in behavior and mindset. Without ‘an Agile culture’ and ‘Agile people’ fallback to traditional behavior is close by and benefits from an Agile transformation shrink rapidly. Can you explain what Personal Agility is, so that the people in your organization understand what is expected from them? After this session you can!

This session will explain the 4 aspects of being Agile: 
•	Agile collaboration (COLLABORATION)
•	Agile attitude (ATTITUDE)
•	Agile solutions (SOLUTION)
•	Agile way of working (METHOD)

Each aspect will be made tangible –and the model is best explained- by using many explicit examples of less versus more Agile. 
The participants will be invited to actively apply what they learn by filling in the short version of the personal agility assessment during the session.
