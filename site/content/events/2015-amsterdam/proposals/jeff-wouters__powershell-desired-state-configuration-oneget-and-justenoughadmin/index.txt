title: "PowerShell, Desired State Configuration, OneGet and JustEnoughAdmin"
---

**Abstract:**

More than a decade ago Jeffrey Snover, the architect of Windows PowerShell, wrote the Monad Manifesto.
Here he described the problem he was seeing, and his vision of solving it. With that, the foundation of what we now know as PowerShell was set.
One of the pillars of this document was the ability to use declarative syntax for configuration management: Desired State Configuration.

The logical next step would be to integrate with solutions to deploy software (packages): OneGet.
And last, but not least in any way, to do this in a way that is as secure as possible: JustEnoughAdmin.

Throughout this day we’ll teach you how to use Desired State Configuration, OneGet and JustEnoughAdmin. No more investigating why it stopped working in production, when it works in development/test/acceptation environments. No more playing ‘look for the difference’ on your systems. We’ll teach you how to do DevOps the way it was intended, with very little effort.

It's Jeff Wouters.
