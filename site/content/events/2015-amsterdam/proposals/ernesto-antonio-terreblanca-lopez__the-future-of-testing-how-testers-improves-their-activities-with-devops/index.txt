Test early, test continuously and deliver quality, this is the main idea of Testing in DevOps.

Continuous Testing helps DevOps teams balance quality and speed, It uses automation, the cloud and service virtualization to eliminate testing bottlenecks and simplifies the creation of test environments that can be more easily deployed, shared and updated as systems change.
