title: "Why immutable infrastructure?"
---

**Abstract:**

I'd like to present the evolution of infrastructure up to the modern day: from big physical snowflake-like servers to the modern immutable and disposable containers.

During this ignite talk I'd like to answer the following questions:
* Why have we ended up with immutable infrastructure? 
* What are the challenges for the system administrators when moving towards immutable infrastructure?
* What are the benefits? 
* Why can't we just continue reusing the servers/VMs like we've got used to? 
* How immutable infrastructure influences Continuous Delivery process?

**Speaker:**

Pavel Chunyayev works as a continuous delivery architect at Levi9 IT Services and has more than 10 years of experience in IT Operations. 

He has helped more than a dozen customers to assess and improve their release/deployment processes, and run their applications better in production.
