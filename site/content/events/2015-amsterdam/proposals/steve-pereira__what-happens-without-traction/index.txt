title: "What Happens Without Traction?"
---

**Abstract:**

"What if you're not the CTO and you want to improve your quality, performance and stability? 
This is my story of working within low buy-in, legacy, siloed organizations to break down barriers, blur borders and eliminate constraints. I’ll also tie in material from ‘Driving Technical Change’ and ‘Building a DevOps Culture’

We’ll cover:
- tribes and guilds vs silos and departments
- easy wins
- low impact tools
- talking the talk and walking the walk
- trust and building confidence

What you get:
Clear guidance on navigating a corporate nightmare to make progress with DevOps"

**Speaker:**

He runs Toronto's monthly DevOps and OpenStack meetups and DevOps Days Toronto. Steve is unreasonably fond of beer, throwing frisbees and a giant fan of all things software.
