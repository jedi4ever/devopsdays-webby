title: "The elephant in the room - how do I actually attract, build and retain my DevOps team?"
---

**Abstract:**

You’ve defined the strategy, you’ve changed the mindset and you’re ready to implement DevOps practices. Now, where do I find these superstars, how do I convince them to join the journey and how do I retain their services?

One of the most difficult areas in the implementation of DevOps practices is finding exceptional people with the relevant skills who can put the strategy created into practice.

Huge amounts of organisations demand DevOps related skills, but there is a significant shortage, how do we set ourselves aside from the rest? Demand far exceeds supply, we need to ensure we are different.

**Speaker:**
