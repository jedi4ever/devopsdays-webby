title: "DevOps from an investor's perspective"
---

**Abstract:**

Investors - like VCs and strategy planners inside companies - are starting to hear about DevOps and are curious how they might profit from it. This talk is a DevOpsDays version of what those investors want to know, explaing how they view emerging markets like DevOps and evaluate investment into the markets.

It contains a "case" for evaluating investments in DevOps, covering the viablity of DevOps from their perspective and possible ways that "DevOps" could effect the models and valuations that investors are performing.

The question being answered is: "should I invest in DevOps? Does that even make sense?"

**Speaker:**

I'm a sometimes industry analyst (having worked at RedMonk and 451 Research), corporate strategist (Dell), and former programmer.

Now I work at Pivotal in technical marketing for Pivotal Cloud Foundry. Cloud!
