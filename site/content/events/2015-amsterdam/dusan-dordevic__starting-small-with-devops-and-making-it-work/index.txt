title: "Starting small with Devops and making it work"
---

**Abstract:**

When I joined aerlingus.com as a consultant, I was first member of team that was tasked to migrate aerlingus.com to Amazon cloud. AerLingus is Irish national air carrier, ex-government owned, now public company. Around 75% of company sales go through that site, which is around 1.2 B EUR/year. Current site relies on bunch of legacy technologies (Solaris, IBM mainframe, etc...). There was 0 lines of documentation about anything and there was no drive nor understanding from management to do devops. Still in a year time we managed to establish some devops procedures. Main things that I would like to illustrate in this talk is
-Enterprises are not complex and unique, but alike

-It is possible to do enterprise devops, side by side with ITIL
-It is possible to sell devops to organization from within, simply because it works
-It is possible to connect legacy and new, we have direct connectivity between mainframe and Amazon cloud
-Illustrate how we are using Kanban as main methodology for collaboration between teams and how we convinced organization to use it

I would also like to illustrate key mistakes we made:
-To some extent you can sell devops to organization from within, but to really do it you need to have organizational drive
-Silos still continued to exist

I would still need to get confirmation from AerLingus if I may use name in presentation, otherwise it can be presented as Irish Airline company
