title: "Retrospective"
---

**Abstract:**

Scrum, Kanban, XP, whatever - regardless of method, the retrospective is an oft overlooked/undervalued technique in the agile toolbox. In this workshop I would like to demonstrate the potential of the retrospective through running a retrospective on DevOPS Days itself.

I will use (and explain) the retrospective framework as described by Derby & Larsen in Agile Retrospectives (Making good teams great) to do so, thereby giving the attendees the basis to go ahead with their own retrospectives.

**Speaker:**

Ciarán is a process coach with a strong technical background.

As a one time developer who, as agile coach, is building a specialist niche in a hosting environment he has developed a strong interest in the DevOPs movement.

This complements his generalist tendencies while challenging his DEV bias.
