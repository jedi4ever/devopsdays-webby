title: "Test Optimization: What's changed?"
---

**Abstract:**

As a developer, are you testing the code you changed? Are you sure?
As a tester, do you focus on what the developer just broke?
As a project lead, do you know what your test exposure is?
Does your build process update your code coverage?
Do you spend more time testing than you should?

Think about testing a different way. Come hear about test optimization.
We will walk through day-to-day scenarios for developers, testers, the build team and project managers and how they can do their job better through a deeper understanding of how their application is tested.
