title: "Time Series Metrics@Betfair"
---

**Abstract:**

Time Series Metrics are the lifeblood of your systems. The ability to capture, store, interrogate and alert from that data is a wonderful thing.

This session describes, at a high level, what they are and how Betfair is making amazing use of them by combining the open source projects OpenTSDB and Riemann and our own “special sauce”, OpenTSP.

**Speaker:**

David Webster is a Betfair veteran of 12 years.

He’s held many positions in that time but currently manages the UK Site Reliability team and has a passion for the monitoring systems required to support their production estate.

This estate processes in excess of 70 million betting transactions on a busy day so Betfair’s monitoring systems are bigger than some company’s customer facing systems.

He lives with his wife and three children on the Suffolk coast and is a member of the local RNLI lifeboat crew.
