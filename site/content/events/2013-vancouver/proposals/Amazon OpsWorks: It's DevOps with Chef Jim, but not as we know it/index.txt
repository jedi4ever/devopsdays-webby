title: "Amazon OpsWorks: It's DevOps with Chef Jim, but not as we know it"
---

**Abstract:**

Amazon OpsWorks was released in Feb 2013 quietly nestled alongside EC2, CloudFront, Cloudwatch and the many other Amazon Cloud service offerings. At it's core OpsWorks is based on Chef, although Amazons take on Chef bears some noteworthy differences from the Chef you might be used to. 
 
 In this talk we'll discuss DeNA's use of OpsWorks and it's unique approach to DevOps using Chef, how it works in practice and we'll also highlight the key differences between Amazon OpsWorks Chef and OpsCode's original design for Chef.

 Lastly we'll summarize what key constraints/limitations you ought to be aware of when considering using OpsWorks which still has a ways to mature further - we're in conversation with the PM for Amazon Opsworks who we'd like to get up from Seattle to highlight some key improvements that they are willing to discuss from their roadmap (TBC).

**Speaker:**

Yuichiro Mori - Sr Server Engineer, DeNA

Jerome Pimmel - Sr Dir Engineering, DeNA

Chris Barclay, AWS
