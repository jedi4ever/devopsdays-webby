title: "Service Virtualization: the New Wave in Application Development"
---

**Abstract:**

Service Virtualization differs from traditional definitions of virtualization in that it abstracts downstream components or entire applications with which you integrate as part of a business service to allow you to remove the dependency on those components and/or applications and thus deserialize the SDLC.  

This session will begin by examining the risks associated with traditional application development from both various perspectives.  The use of virtual services will then be discussed as a high impact means of mitigating these risks.  

Empirical data has shown that incorporating virtual services into an application development organization's best practices can compress the SDLC by 30% or more due to an ability to more aggressively attack the goal of true parallel development.
