title: Sensu Introduction
---

**Abstract:**

This talk is an introduction to Sensu, an open source monitoring framework
designed for the "cloud". I tell the story of how Sensu came to be, it's design
goals, and the philosophy behind it. I explain how Sensu works, how it's configured,
and provide practical usage examples. I share my experiences operating Sensu at
scale and demonstrate what it's like to work with Sensu and Opscode's Chef.
