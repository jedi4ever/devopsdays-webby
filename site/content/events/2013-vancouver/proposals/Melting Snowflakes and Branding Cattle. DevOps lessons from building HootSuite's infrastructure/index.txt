title: "Melting Snowflakes and Branding Cattle. DevOps lessons from building HootSuite's infrastructure"
---

**Abstract:**

Traditional ops processes treat servers like pets or snowflakes,  early #devops tools are snowflake factories.  I present an alternative model of server management, "Culling the Herd", and discuss the reasons why this model requires a complete #devops lifecycle to fully realize the benefits, and how I came to this realization while scaling HootSuite's infrastructure from .25m users through to 7.5m (and counting).
