title: "Living system or build factory. Two approaches to operations"
---

**Abstract:**

Two opposing but complementary methods of deploying systems:

1. Gold server / image :: Tools such as ansible, puppet, makefiles, scripting, etc as build factories to create images for deployment.  Homogeneous systems.

2. Living system :: Tools such as puppet / chef as controllers of living systems, ensuring basic compliance, but creating heterogeneous systems when birthed later as dependencies change.
