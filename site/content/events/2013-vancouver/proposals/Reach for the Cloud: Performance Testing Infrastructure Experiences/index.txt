title: "Reach for the Cloud: Performance Testing Infrastructure Experiences"
---

**Abstract:**

The format of the presentation is an experience report on building a performance test infrastructure in the cloud.
I will speak about the requirements, the challenges and the steps undertaken to make this work.

In Optimus' testing practice we worked with a client who wanted to have their web site tested quick and with up to 40,000 users.
There was little time, little budget and no performance testing infrastructure yet to support this.

With previous experience with JMeter as a performance testing and with our knowledge of the possibilities in the cloud environment we decided to roll out our own infrastructure.
The presentation will take you through the steps and will tell about our experiences.
