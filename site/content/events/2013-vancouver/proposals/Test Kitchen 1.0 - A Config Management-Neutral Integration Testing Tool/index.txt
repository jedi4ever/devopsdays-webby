title: "Test Kitchen 1.0 - A Config Management-Neutral Integration Testing Tool"
---

**Abstract:**

We've come a long way with infrastructure as code and are getting closer to better test frameworks and facilities. Test Kitchen was originally developed with Chef in mind, but it is now becoming a standard across different configuration management tools.

This talk will focus on how Test Kitchen can help you shorten the feedback cycle during the development of infrastructure code and discover how it plays nice with other existing tools like ChefSpec, RSpec Puppet, and Vagrant.

Learn about unit and smoke testing infrastructure as code in a Test Driven Development (TDD) cycle. Besides the technology we will look into the benefits of this faster feedback cycle and the current/future state of infrastructure as code testing.
