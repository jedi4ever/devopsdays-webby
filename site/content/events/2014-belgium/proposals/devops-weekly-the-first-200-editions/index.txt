---
This ignite talk will look back on nearly 4 years of cataloguing the
DevOps conversation online. We'll look at:

* How is the newsletter created?
* What are my favourite posts from the archive?
* What are some of the themes that have emerged over the last 4 years?
* What are the best tools I've featured?
* And who has had more posts included than anyone else?

The talk should be a light hearted jog through the evolution of the
devops community. Hopefully we'll discover how we got here, and if
we're really lucky maybe where we're heading.

Gareth is a professional and experienced software and operations engineer based in Cambridge, UK.
He is the author of the devops weekly newsletter.
