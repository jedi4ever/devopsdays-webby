If there is one person in the world who I think could provide an excellent foundation for DevOps it must be Henry Mintzberg. I’m currently reading his book “The Structuring of Organizations” (published in 1979!) and it contains all the elements to predict all the things that DevOps stands for (at least the cultural side of it) in an environment as complex, dynamic and creative as automating business processes in a rapidly changing world.

Here is a link to the book: <http://www.amazon.com/The-Structuring-Organizations-Henry-Mintzberg/dp/0138552703/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&qid=1397921530&sr=8-10>
