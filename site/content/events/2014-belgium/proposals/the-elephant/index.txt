title: "The elephant in the room - how do I actually attract, build and retain my DevOps team?"
---
You’ve defined the strategy, you’ve changed the mindset and you’re ready to implement DevOps practices.  Now, where do I find these people, how do I convince them to join and how do I make sure they stay?

One of the most difficult areas in the implementation of DevOps practices is finding people with the relevant skills to put the strategy created into practice. So many companies want DevOps related skills, but there is a huge shortage, how do we set ourselves aside from the rest? Demand far exceeds supply, we need to make sure we are different.

Tony Chapman has founded and built a specialist DevOps agency called [LinuxRecruit](http://www.linuxrecruit.co.uk) who are working with organisations across the UK, building their DevOps strategy and fully staffing their DevOps teams. Tony was recently shortlisted for Recruiter of the Year 2012 at the prestigious national Recruiter for Excellence Awards and LinuxRecruit were shortlisted for newcomer agency of the year at the 2013 awards. He is a key contributor to the Open Source community, has a regular column in Linux Format Magazine and is organiser of the DevOps Exchange in London.
