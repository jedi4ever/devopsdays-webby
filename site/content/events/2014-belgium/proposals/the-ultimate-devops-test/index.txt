title: "The ultimate DevOps test"

"Culture", "tearing down the silos", "continuous integration", "infrastructure orchestration", …
Did DevOps fall into the buzzwords trap? Do some of us use certain terms mechanically,
just because everybody's doing it, without a 100% confidence we grasped their meaning?
Or, even worse: we are more than positive we got it, but we actually didn't?

Let's do a sanity check: will we be able to tell the difference
between sentences authored by actual people and a well-fed Markov chain text generator?
The condition of our community rests on our shoulders!

Marta Paciorkowska is a junior software engineer at [Three of Coins](http://3ofcoins.net),

She tries to actively work towards making programming communities
more inclusive, safer spaces, and is one of the ten funniest people she knows.
