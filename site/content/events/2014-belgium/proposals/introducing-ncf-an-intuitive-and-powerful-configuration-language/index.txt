title: "Introducing ncf: an intuitive and powerful configuration language"
---
This Ignite talk will introduce ncf through the explanation of why it was built,
and what problem it attempts to solve. This will not be a technical talk,
rather an overview of the motivation, core principles and key points that lead to building ncf,
and a quick glance at what the result looks like.

In a nutshell, what is ncf? Well, CFEngine 3 is a powerful configuration management tool that's speed,
small footprint, multi-platform support, network resilience and smart agent-based approach attract many.
However, many have a hard time with the language and tooling, and need an easier way.
CFEngine has been described as flour, eggs, milk and butter: all the ingredients needed to make a cake,
but no recipe. ncf is that missing recipe - and much more.

ncf's philosophy is built around the core concepts (beware! acronyms!):
DRY, KISS, POLA, intuitive, extensible, open source.
