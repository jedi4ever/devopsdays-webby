title: DoS yourself in production to prove you can take it
---

**Abstract:**

At JUST EAT, we haven't had an embarrassing performance regression that we haven't noticed and put right on the same day we deployed it - for over two years now. We also haven't been taken down by unexpected load.

We have around 150 engineers deploying tens of times a week across around 60 different components in production. In 2014, we pushed more than 800 discrete changes and coped with around 50% more traffic as we grew. Our uptime has… gone up.

We don't:

- have engineers run a performance test before we release
- have engineers run capacity tests every month or so when we remember to

Instead, we do something a bit different...
