title: "Growing an ops team from 1 founder"
---

**Abstract:**

Given the sysadmin stereotype, it's sometimes easy to forget that not everyone is up at 3am and ready to respond to alerts on a Friday night. In all but the most critical high availability environments, most teams will not have someone actively monitoring graphs 24/7. This means you have to deal with on-call schedules, technical handoffs, documentation, procedure manuals and trying to ensure mistakes aren't made, even in the middle of the night.

This talk will look at how to approach the social aspects of running an ops team in terms of the human impact as well as using automation and tools.

**Speaker:**

David Mytton is the founder of server monitoring tool, Server Density, where he has been using MongoDB in production for almost 4 years. He has been programming in PHP and Python for over 10 years, regularly speaks about MongoDB (including starting the London MongoDB User Group), co-founded the Open Rights Group and can often be found cycling in London or drinking tea in Japan.
