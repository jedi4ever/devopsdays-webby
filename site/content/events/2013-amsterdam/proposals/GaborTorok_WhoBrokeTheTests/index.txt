title: Who broke the tests?
---

**Abstract:**

As Kanban helps to highlight the bottlenecks in your project and
understand your workflow, make problems visible the same way in your
engineering processes, too.

The essence of continuous delivery is that your code base should
always be in a deployable state. And you want to add the less overhead
and complexity to your system.

What should happen if you want to deploy but tests are broken?  How
will you find out who or what broke them? Who will fix them? Was there
a problem with the tests? Is the VCS server down again? Or is it
really the feature broken?

I will talk about how frank communication on who broke the tests
helped us to solve these problems in a no-blame engineering culture.
Also I will present the technologies and methods we used to achieve
it.

After several years of back-end and front-end development, Gábor joined Prezi's QA team. At Prezi, he's always finding new ways to automatize product testing. He prefers Emacs over Vim.

He can't say no if you invite him for a drink, and if you don't see him for a short time, he's probably doing yoga in a quiet room or dancing at a psychedelic party.
