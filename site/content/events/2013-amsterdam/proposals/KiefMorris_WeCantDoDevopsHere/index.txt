title: "We can't do Devops Here"
---

**Abstract:**

A growing number of people in the corporate world are becoming aware
of DevOps, and hoping that its ideas can help them become better at
delivering and supporting software. I've had the opportunity to meet,
visit, and work with a number of companies looking into this, and I've
noticed a some patterns in the things that people think make DevOps
too hard to make work for them.

"DevOps sounds great in theory, but it isn't realistic for us, it just
wouldn't work here".

The company where the development team needs to talk to 12 different
teams and wait 6 weeks in order to get a new virtual machine. For
development.

The team which has two people whose full time job is merging code branches.

The development team which developed an automatically deployable
application on Linux on AWS and delivered it to an IT team which
deployed by hand to Solaris.

I can't claim to have solved all of these problems, but I have found a
number of patterns and approaches which have been useful in moving
people in the right direction, and I would like to share and discuss
them.
