title: "Building cross region and cross cloud high availability into your app"
---

**Abstract:**

A real life case: Achieving high levels of availability and disaster recovery in a cloud environment requires the implementation of patterns and practices that introduce redundancy through multi-zone, multi-region, and multi-cloud deployments. As we move towards implementing higher availability, we cannot escape the direct increase in the accidental complexity of the deployment architecture resulting from lack of cloud portability and deployment lifecycle automation. We present a solution approach implemented by a real-world user for achieving high availability and disaster recovery using the Cloudify open source framework. This approach applies to not just AWS, but also other public clouds and private cloud environments such as Eucalyptus . The resulting reference architecture provides portable PostgreSQL replication and disaster recovery as well as application tier scalability across zones, regions, and public/private clouds through a unified deployment workflow.
