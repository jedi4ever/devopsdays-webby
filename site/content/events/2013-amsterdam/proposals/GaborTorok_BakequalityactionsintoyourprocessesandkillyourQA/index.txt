title: "Bake quality actions into your processes and kill your QA"
---

**Abstract:**

Follow me on the journey how we learnt that bugs are product, QA is
rather quality actions, and DevOps is about ownership.

In the recent years we went through all the typical problems. We had
low quality tests that were sometimes also slow, flaky and broken for
a long time. Developers depended too much on operations team. They did
not care about monitoring. QA was a single person in the team, the
blocker role in release. We had too much open bugs we did not fix but
still spent huge amount of time maintaining them. Teams didn't feel
responsible for their feature, there was no clear rule which team is
responsible for upcoming bugs.

In my talk I will focus on the learnings of our journey and how we
solved these problems.

How it ended up in an agile company working in continuous delivery
that we don't have DevOps team nor QA team any more and still we have
solid test frameworks, we do trust in our tests, developers take full
ownership of the features they develop and are on call for critical
services, UX team is dealing with product bugs, and teams have clear
responsibility boundaries.

After several years of back-end and front-end development, Gábor joined Prezi's QA team. At Prezi, he's always finding new ways to automatize product testing. He prefers Emacs over Vim.

He can't say no if you invite him for a drink, and if you don't see him for a short time, he's probably doing yoga in a quiet room or dancing at a psychedelic party.
