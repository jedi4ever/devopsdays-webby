title: "Aeolus and Katello FTW (For the Win)"
---

**Abstract:**

Recent years have seen an influx of Cloud Computing services offered by 
a plethora of vendors with many different APIs and interfaces. The 
diversity of these products offer many solutions at various levels of 
the stack, but increases the risk of proprietary cloud adoption due to 
vendor lock-in and downtime. 
With Aeolus we aim to provide a Free and Open Source cloud computing
framework through which instances can be launched against any cloud provider
using the same API and toolset.  The infrastructure permits the 
description of software services and hardware components in such a way 
that any set of software packages can be deployed to any cloud provider 
matching specified criteria.
For Katello i will show how to manage running instances, apply errata,
do updates, compare status with deployed images, manage content effectively.
All of this to simplify the life of sysadmins and devops.
