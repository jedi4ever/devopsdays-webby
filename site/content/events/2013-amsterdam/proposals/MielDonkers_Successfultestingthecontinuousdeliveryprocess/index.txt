title: "Successful testing the continuous delivery process"
---

**Abstract:**

Many organisations want to shorten their time-to-market. By
implementing agile they try to shorten the delivery time. Agile
projects use practices like continuous integration, automated
deployment, (acceptance) test-driven development and regression
test automation to get to continuous delivery. In this process build,
integration, test, and deployment automation plays an important role.

The delivery of software has to become fast and reliable. But what
does it take to get to continuous delivery? What are the testing
challenges we face in a continuous delivery? Which test strategies can
we apply be able to test continuous delivery?

This talk zooms in on fully automated testing and a high degree
of automation in the business facing testing to get to continuous
delivery. It focusses on solutions (tooling) within a continuous
delivery model from a testing perspective. It gives the participants
insights in the use of requirements management tooling, test
solutions built with tooling like Selenium and Fitnesse, JMeter,
Appdynamics and other tooling. How can deployment processes
be implemented with the use of the right (often lightweight)
tooling? Which test strategy fits in this process and how to organize
collaboration between developers, testers and operations?

Finally this talk gives practical examples of projects were these
solutions were used.
