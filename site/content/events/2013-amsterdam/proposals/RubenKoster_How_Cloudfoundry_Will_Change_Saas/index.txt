title: "How Cloudfoundry will change Saas (and why you should be using BOSH)"
---

**Abstract:**

Presentation about how we as developers all face the same problem;
The problem of running applications and their services and scaling them.
But that we all solve this problem using a different technology stack.
This talk will be a call to action to unite our forces to solve this problem together.
By using "Open standards with broad industry support".
The proposed stack will be CloudFoundry deployed by BOSH on OpenStack.
This talk is intended as a discussion starter and to help people understand the problem space.
