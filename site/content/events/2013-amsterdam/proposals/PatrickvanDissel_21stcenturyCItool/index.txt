title: 21st Century CI tool
---

**Abstract:**

Describe pain-points of currently existing CI tools based on practices/principles of the 21st century, and high level how I think this can be improved. Hinting to my open-space which is my second proposal.
 
**Speaker:**

Patrick van Dissel, Software Engineer working at Tricode in The Netherlands. I've been setting-up, maintaining and improving the continuous integration/delivery pipeline from the technical side for the last 2 years now. During this time I've been looking at all kinds of aspects to get better code and get it to production faster.

It boils down to:
I came to the conclusion that I'm not happy with the existing so called "Continuous Integration" tools like Hudson/Jenkins, Go, TeamCity, AntHill, TravisCI, etc. They get the job done, but they don't follow the principles of this age, like:
- Configuration-as-Code
- Infrastructure-as-Code
- Keep It Simple Stupid
- Don't Repeat Yourself
- Single Responsibility Principle
I've investigated if I could help improve the existing tools to up-to-date. But at a code level it just looked not doable.

So, in my free time, I started my own CI tool project. You can read the specifics at:
