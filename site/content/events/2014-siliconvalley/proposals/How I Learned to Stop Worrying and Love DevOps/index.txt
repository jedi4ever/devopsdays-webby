**Abstract:**

I was a college-student BOFH, an ISP sysadmin, and an academic IT
manager. If I wanted a curmudgeonly sysadmin, I could just look in a
mirror. Most developers were unlikely to be granted root on any
systems whatsoever, and servers were carefully hand-whittled works of
art. You know, The Way Things Were.

Moving to a role doing operations at a developer-centric startup was
both a culture shock and a great learning experience. I'll discuss
what worked for me (and what was challenging!) in terms of my
transition to a DevOps practice.

Spoiler alert: change is scary, but awesome developers on the team
make it much easier for an old-school sysadmin to be assimilated into
the DevOps of Borg. Wacky hijinx ensue, and there's a hilarious coda:
as it turns out, having your startup acquired means that in IT's view,
you're the cowboy now! All sorts of empathy potential!
