**Abstract:**

Seven ways people habitually screw up software deployment
infrastructures, performed entirely in verse.

Notes: I've done this Ignite several other places and it's on YouTube.
However, it's still a lot of fun, and it's WAY to appropriate not to
submit it for DevOpsDays.

**Speaker:**

Josh Berkus is on the PostgreSQL Core Team and is also the main author
of the HandyRep failover tool. Handyrep is a good start, but we still
have further to go.
