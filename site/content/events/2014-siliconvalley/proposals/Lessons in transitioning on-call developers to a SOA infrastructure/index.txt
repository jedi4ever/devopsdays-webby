title: "Lessons in transitioning on-call developers to a SOA infrastructure"

**Abstract:**

PagerDuty has always put all developers on-call. In the last few
years, we have transitioned from a handful of developers, working on a
monolithic Rails app, to dozens of engineers and a dozen internal
services. While the technical architecture and delegation of
development work had very natural divisions, we found that it was
important to keep on-call responsibilities broad to cover more than
the service-level divisions. This creates several challenges, one of
which is keeping on-calls empowered and happy covering pages from
services they are not actively developing.

This talk will focus on the motivations behind keeping broad on-call
responsibilities, the operational tactics that equip on-calls with the
breadth of knowledge necessary to maintain the services they respond
to, and the cultural strategies for keeping your engineersâ€™ urge to
kill each other from rising.

**Speaker:**

Owen has been a developer at PagerDuty for two years working on its
highly available platform for processing critical alerts. Today, he
focuses on a reliable messaging service that ensure all calls,
messages, and emails are timely received by customers.
