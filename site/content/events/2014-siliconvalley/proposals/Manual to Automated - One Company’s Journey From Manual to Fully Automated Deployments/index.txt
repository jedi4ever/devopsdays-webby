**Abstract:**

You’ve heard of ChatOps, Jenkins, Hubot, git hooks, Capistrano,
continuous integration tools, and lots more. But how do you glue these
together into a solution that gets your code and artifacts from
development to production? Everyone’s environment is different, and
what works for some (e.g. rsync of code) may not work for another.
We’ll discuss the evolution of our deployment processes and tools at
VividCortex, from command line scripts to fully automated deployments
via ChatOps.

In the beginning, there was command line tools and everything was
good. Then you add a couple more team members. Even though you think
command line tools are simple the new team members find them
unfamiliar. They are new of course and are in general apprehensive
about pushing their changes to production for fear of doing something
that brings down the application. So the new team members ask you to
deploy or just don’t deploy very often, and you have become the key
master for deployments. If you are out that day or unavailable or even
worse get hit by a bus then nothing gets deployed. This can be a big
problem if you are trying to iterate fast.

So you begin to look for ways to remove yourself as a bottleneck. The
first step is to automate those deployments. This is where a tool like
Jenkins makes sense. You create jobs in Jenkins to run those existing
command line deployment scripts. Jenkins gives you a UI with a button
to push to run that deployment script. As a result, those team members
which were not deploying before, are now deploying regularly. However
not all of them are deploying yet, and you also added another couple
of team member, but for some reason they are not deploying anything.
When you ask why, they say don’t know how.

So you begin to look for ways to make those commands you automated
more accessible and discoverable. You would probably start off with
documentation in a wiki. However, you still have a problem of
discoverability of the wiki. If your company is like ours then the
chatroom is the common area of your company. This is where everyone is
communicating in real time. If you make those commands, you automated
in Jenkins available in the chatroom then; you have solved, the
problem of discoverability and accessibility. This is one of the big
ideas behind ChatOps. By putting those tools in the middle of the chat
conversation the new team members are learning by seeing the existing
team members run those commands. Now new team members are pushing code
to production within the first few days, and the existing team members
are pushing code to production multiple times a day.

This is the evolution of deployment at VividCortex. We have a culture
of “ShipIt” which means getting your code into production early and
often. By using Jenkins and ChatOps, we are making what is considered
by many developers to be a scary and confusing process into one that
is considered by our team to be ( dare I say ) fun! The rapid pace of
iteration delights our stakeholder, early adopters are excited to see
new features and having their feedback steer the direction of the
product, and our team members find great satisfaction in seeing the
fruits of their labor being used by our customers.
