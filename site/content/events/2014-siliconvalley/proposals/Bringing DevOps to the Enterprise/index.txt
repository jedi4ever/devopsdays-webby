**Abstract:**

My presentation would be to describe the challenges of growing “DevOps” awareness from an organization that has grown from startup (handful of developers) to enterprise (14 development teams, cloud services, Windows no-fun-ugliness plus Linux).

* Startup in healthcare space beginning in 2000-ish
    * Systems in traditional data center were small – maybe a couple of web servers
    * Manually managed by a team of developers – no real operations knowledge and some network abilities
    * Builds are simple command line make type builds of .NET code, deployed as one monolithic block
    * All code and services deployed to all machines, all machines run everything
    * Developer workstations are essentially images of the machines in production, everything runs on that single machine
* Purchased by a Fortune 15 company in 2006
    * Rapid growth of development teams and applications
    * Builds now take 30 minutes to complete, deployments take several hours
    * Challenges with quarterly deployments mitigated with moving to weekly deployments
    * Attempting to move to more frequent deployments – challenges in dragging along QA
    * Automated Testing
    * Growth of DevOps – it’s still just one person, but that’s changing
    * Growth of Monitoring #monitoringsucks (still)
* Hybrid Public/Private clouds
    * New application deployment models
    * Linux brought into a Windows shop

**Speaker:**

My role? Application architect that has become the primary/sole DevOps
person in an organization, herding cats between 14 dev teams and 4
infrastructure teams…
