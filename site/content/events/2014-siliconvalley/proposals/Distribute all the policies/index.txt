title: "Distribute all the policies!"

**Abstract:**

Most organizations choose to centralize resource and policy management
to make managing it easier. That centralization brings with it some
challenges: single points of failure, scaling, etc. Using DevOps
practices like configuration management, we have the opportunity to
try a different route.

In this talk, we'll discuss why PagerDuty chose to distribute our
policy management. We'll look at how we skipped LDAP and distributed
user management. We will cover our firewall automation which produces
a perfect firewall tailored to each instance. We will profess our love
for HAProxy which intelligently balances traffic between our ever
changing service layers. We will discuss how we created a point to
point IPSec mesh to secure our network traffic. We will discuss how
this architecture is working so far and how we plan to improve the
experience in the future.

**Speaker:**

Doug Barth Operations Engineer at PagerDuty
