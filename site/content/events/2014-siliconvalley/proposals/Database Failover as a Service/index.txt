**Abstract:**

Workshop / Panel

Thanks to modern devops tools, most applications today can be deployed
with some degree of "self-healing". But Relational databases (in this
case, Postgres) still generally involve a descent into shell-scripting
land and manual failovers. How can we make database failover automatic
but trustworthy?

**Speaker:**

Josh Berkus is on the PostgreSQL Core Team and is also the main author
of the HandyRep failover tool. Handyrep is a good start, but we still
have further to go.
