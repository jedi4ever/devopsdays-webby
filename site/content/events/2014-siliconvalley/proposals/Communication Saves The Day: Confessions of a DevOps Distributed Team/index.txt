**Abstract:**

Distributed work is common today and often times the talent you need
for a particular role is not necessarily in the location you need it.
Too many precious hours are spent waiting for a task to complete that
stifles development and operations teams to work together. While
companies like Amazon and Etsy make it seem easy, DevOps is still an
aspiration to many teams. What’s adding to that complexity is now is
working across distributed environments where teams are demanding more
flexible work arrangements.

This talk explores the real-life encounters of a distributed DevOps
team. We’ll explore what strategies teams have previously employed
that didn’t work and what is now considered “good” communication in
today’s DevOps environment. We’ll also show how distributed DevOps
teams are communicating to close the gap of flexible work arrangements
while speeding the delivery of new software into Operations.
