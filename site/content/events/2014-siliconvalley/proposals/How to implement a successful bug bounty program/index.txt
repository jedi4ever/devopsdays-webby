**Abstract:**

[Note: Could be a panel or presentation]

Recent major security breaches at Target and JCPenny have once again
reinforced the need for sensible bug bounty programs at companies with
significant technology components to their business (read: almost all
companies). Major organizations like Facebook, Google, and Heroku
already implement successful bug bounty programs, but many companies
are still reticent to get started due to fear of results. No matter
the size of the company, starting early sets both the culture and
process in place as the company scales.

In this talk, I’ll walk through a first-hand account of how
StatusPage.io implemented a successful bug bounty program from
scratch. We can walk through the policies we adopted, the types of
testers we encountered, the results of having rewards for valid bug
submissions, and how it’s helped us lock down our infrastructure.
We’ll discuss the different types of rewards (from t-shirt only, all
the way through giving actual money for valid submissions), how to
handle the various personalities you’ll encounter with testers, as
well as what to expect and what you should plan for when you’re first
getting started.

The effects of not having a bug bounty program are much akin to
prohibition - black markets for crime form and everyone in general has
a bad time. The good news is that there’s an easy solution, one that
works with market forces, and keeps everyone sleeping well at night.
The goal of the talk is to assuage fears about opening up your systems
to white hat hackers, and how to convince the powers that be that it’s
heavily in a company’s favor to go the white hat route.
