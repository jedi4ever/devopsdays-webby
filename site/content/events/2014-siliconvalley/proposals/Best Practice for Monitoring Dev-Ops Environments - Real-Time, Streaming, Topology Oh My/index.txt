**Abstract:**

DevOps and WebScale applications are fast to build change and scale.
But they are also fast to fail, in fact kinda by design. This puts
tremendous pressure on Operations teams to anticipate and get ahead of
degradations and anomalies before they cause outages.  What are the
best practice for instrumenting, monitoring and managing these  modern
services?  What legacy tools and processes work and don't work?

How necessary are real-time visibility into service topology and
continuos performance monitoring to success? How are today's leaders
coping with the risk of change and the demands of the business for
extremely high levels of availability and scale? How can you turn
monitoring into a value creating business service Learn from a expert
panel of both practitioners and thought leaders.

This topic is of high interest because the very practice of monitoring
and managing applications is in flux and changing rapidly. Simply
using open-source tools or legacy products won't work. There is high
value in sharing experience and advise in this area.
