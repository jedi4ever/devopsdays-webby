**Abstract:**

Incident response is critical in DevOps, especially with SaaS
applications. Like a well-run emergency room, coordinating the right
people with the right information immediately can be the difference
between a minor glitch and a major threat for the business.

Incident Response gets much more complex in a distributed DevOps
world. There are broader sets of skills you need to bring to bear to
manage a production outage. Overlay different geographies with
different timezones and legacy communication tools and the process can
fail quickly.

This talk describes how to run an efficiently incident response
process for hosted services with distributed DevOps teams - using
specific examples from leading companies Specifically we will talk
about how to organize, what processes to follow and what communication
tools are most effective.
