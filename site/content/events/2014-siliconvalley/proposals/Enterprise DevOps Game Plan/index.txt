**Abstract:**

Not every enterprise can adopt or even needs Netflix-style DevOps.
Most enterprises have existing applications deployed on-premise on
VMware and other infrastructures but still recognize the benefits of
the public cloud. This session will provide a practical guide for
enterprises looking to build a real DevOps culture without requiring a
re-architecture of their application or their infrastructure.
 
This talk will discuss the ten principles for designing the perfect
software lab in a world where competitive advantage is synonymous with
business agility. It will demonstrate how to use AWS and Google Cloud
for agile dev/test of VMware workloads and enabling infrastructure for
continuous integration using Jenkins.

**Speaker:**

Navin Thadani is the senior vice president of products at Ravello
Systems. Navin has experience across technology industries ranging
from networking hardware, infrastructure software, to SaaS, working in
senior-level positions with Cisco, Qumranet (the developer of KVM,
acquired by Red Hat) and Red Hat.
