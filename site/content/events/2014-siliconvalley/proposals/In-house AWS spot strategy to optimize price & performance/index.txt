**Abstract:**

Creating an automated AWS Spot strategy with Reserved Instance back
up: A look at how one organizations is managing operations issues
(scaling and price optimization) to achieve an HPC continuous delivery
platform.

Yactraq, a video processing company, is cutting their costs by 65%+ on
average using an approach that leverages the spot instance market.
Yactraq can’t choose the timing of their spot instance use: their
end-customer application facing real-time APIs mean they MUST deliver
constant performance, continuous delivery at near 100% uptime and meet
a performance SLA.

The capacity demand of the system is volatile as it not only depends
on the number of API calls from customers, but also the length and
quality of the videos being processed. Yactraq sees sudden surges of
demand that are as high as 70x typical demand. A priority for
Yactraq’s IT department is managing how high performance computing can
be balanced with costs and variations in demand. Furthermore, Yactraq
was wanting to achieve this goal in a very short period of time as
they had been contracted by a large video marketing company.
Consequently, the solution had to be developer friendly, with simple
automated deployment process, and couldn’t require any code changes.

Their solution now automatically applies AWS Spot strategies, keeping
costs down and performance up and dipping into reserved instances as
needed. After successfully processing more than 60-million seconds of
video,the solution has lowered the on-demand price for Yactraq by 80%,
compared to a 64% overall savings previously. The solution was
deployed in under two weeks and used the existing application as-is
with no modifications.
