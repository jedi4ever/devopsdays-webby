title: "Front-end ops and the OODA loop: A decision cycle time strategy for winning in a hostile internet environment"
email: erik.sowa@gmail.com
---

**Abstract:**

Many organizations are using John Boyd’s OODA loop to describe
business strategies driven by continuous innovation cycles and the
supporting technical practices. In a hostile environment, whether it
is an aerial dogfight or an advertising-supported internet business,
survival itself depends on executing the observe-orient-decide-act
loop faster than the threat. At Scripps Networks Interactive, we are
doing online video syndication and we surely have to contend with a
hostile environment. In this talk, I will discuss how we moved our
decision cycle time from weeks to hours by instrumenting our embedded
video player and using our data operating system to understand what is
happening in the field ("front-end ops"). To get the cycle time to
minutes or even seconds may require a culture similar to the culture
of successful maneuver warfare teams.
