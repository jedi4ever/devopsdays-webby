**Abstract:**

Once upon a time, Cinderella relied on fairy god mother to make her
dreams come true. Modern day cinderella on the other hand uses her
intelligence, tools and technologies to achieve success. Along the
same lines, classic software development tools and processes fail to
deliver in the modern world. This ignite talk presents an approach to
tools and technology choices that can be taken to transform software
and software development processes from classic to contemporary
