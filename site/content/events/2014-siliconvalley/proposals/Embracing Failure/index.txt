title: "Embracing Failure: Fault Injection and Service Resilience at Netflix"
email: jevans@netflix.com
---

**Abstract:**

Complex distributed systems fail. They fail more and in different ways
as they scale and evolve over time. To provide high service
availability in the face of this reality we must embrace failure by
designing and testing for it. More importantly we must induce
controlled failures on systems to discover vulnerabilities and resolve
them. To this end Netflix has created a suite of tools, collectively
called the Simian Army, to improve resiliency of our cloud
environment. This presentation will cover the motivations for inducing
failure in production, the mechanics of how Netflix achieves it, and
lessons learned along the way.

​This content will be presented at NANOG61 on June 4th but I don't expect high overlap in audience. 

**Speaker:**

Josh Evans, Director of Operations Engineering Netflix
