title: "Embracing Failure: Fault Injection and Service Resilience at Netflix"
email: jevans@netflix.com
---

**Abstract:**

Complex distributed systems fail. They fail more and in different ways
as they scale and evolve over time. To provide high service
availability in the face of this reality we must embrace failure by
designing and testing for it. More importantly we must induce
controlled failures on systems to discover vulnerabilities and resolve
them. To this end Netflix has created a suite of tools, collectively
called the Simian Army, to improve resiliency of our cloud
environment. This presentation will cover the motivations for inducing
failure in production, the mechanics of how Netflix achieves it, and
lessons learned along the way.

​This content will be presented at NANOG61 on June 4th but I don't expect high overlap in audience. 

**Speaker:**

Josh Evans is a 15-year Netflix veteran with a background in
ecommerce, video streaming services, distributed systems, tools, and
operations. Josh is currently Director of Operations Engineering at
Netflix and is responsible for enabling continuous improvement of
service quality and acceleration of engineering velocity. Josh’s team
creates and evolves Netflix Open Source tools like Asgard and the
Simian Army, which includes the Chaos Monkey.
