title: "Continuous delivery for desktop applications - Release from the pub"
---
**Abstract:**

In the recent year we decreased the time needed to release Prezi’s
desktop application from 3 days of manual work to a 3-hour automated
process. Instead of spending time on the release procedure, engineers
could focus on product development that actually brings value to the
user.


The concept of continuous delivery is well known and used for web
applications. You make changes in the code, push it to a common
repository, run your automated tests against the changes and if
everything went well, you can deploy to production right away. With
the right tools this can take minutes. But what happens to your
desktop application that can be installed on different operating
systems with different versions? In our case this means Windows and
Mac platforms. Releasing an application like that can be time
consuming and lots of manual work. I would like to talk about how we
made the release process fully automated, relatively quick and
reliable from creating installers to running automated tests to
monitoring so you could release the next version of our application
from even a pub. Just as we did to celebrate our achievement.
