**Abstract:**

Can be Ignite

Many people, at some point in their lives, will find their memory
capabilities not fully functional.  There are several possible causes
for this, and various remediations and work-arounds.  'Wetware' is as
much a part of DevOps as hardware and software, so it is beneficial to
look at how to maintain function when our memories start to fail.

Outline:

Causes - Three Broad Classes:
1) Stress and Fatigue
2) Brain Injury or Illness
3) Aging
Work-Arounds:
* Notes
* Written Reqs
* Commenting Code
* Searchable Documentation
* Structure or Habit
* Pair/Partner/Team
