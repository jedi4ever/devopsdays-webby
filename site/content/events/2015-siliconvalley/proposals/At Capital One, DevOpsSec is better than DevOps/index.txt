title: "At Capital One, DevOpsSec is better than DevOps"
---

**Abstract:**

Speed is the new currency in software development world. DevOps practices with tools and automation; shift-left mentality; and transparency of the delivery pipeline allow a team to deliver business values to the customer rapidly. However, the security aspects are often overlooked or come as an after-thought. For a large financial institute like Capital One, security is a top priority. Even though we are not a unicorn like Facebook, Netflix, Etsy etc., we are maturing in our DevOps practices rapidly. We have gone one step further by bringing in Information Security in the mix – DevOpsSec!

In this presentation, we will describe how we have embedded Information Security into the development lifecycle – starting from the development tools, continuous integration, shared library management and testing. We are also working towards embedding Information Security in our infrastructure automation.
