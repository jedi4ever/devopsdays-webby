title: "Leveraging the AWS Platform for DevOps"
---

**Abstract:**

Amazon Web Services provides the opportunity for a high degree of automation, making it an ideal platform for implementing DevOps practices. Weâ€™ll demonstrate how we implement true DevOps on the AWS platform using AWS CloudFormation, Python boto library, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) and Fluxboard (a customized Jenkins IT process solution). We will provide an example setup for a standard application and share best practices from the 100+ implementations Flux7 has been a part of.
