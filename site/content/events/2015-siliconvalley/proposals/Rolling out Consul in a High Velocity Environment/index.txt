title: "Rolling out Consul in a High Velocity Environment"
---

**Abstract:**

In the winter of 2014, we wanted integrate Consul into our production environment where we were ingesting 1 million metrics per second. We had 350 VMs in AWS and were having pain around service discovery and quick configuration changes.
This is the story of how we integrated Consul into our environment, what it helped us with, mistakes we made and some tips for successful implementation in your own environment.
9 months later, our 700 VMs receiving 3 million metrics per second were using Consul to facilitate 60 second cluster-wide configuration changes and make service discovery simpler and more flexible.

What they'll hopefully learn from the talk:

How they can use Consul to help solve Service Discovery and Configuration problems with minimal pain.
