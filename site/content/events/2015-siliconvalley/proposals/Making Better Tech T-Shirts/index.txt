title: "Making Better Tech T-Shirts"
---

**Abstract:**

Everyone in tech loves T-shirts! After all, an April Fool’s Day post on Tumblr by The Halting Problem contained this headline: “Study Reveals Average Tech Worker’s Wardrobe Consists of 85% Free Tech T-shirts.”

In this short, funny talk, we will go into everything that people in tech need to know about T-shirts -- but hopefully not too much!

Why people in tech love T-shirts
How T-shirts can be used by conferences, sponsors, speakers, and attendees
How to design T-shirts for conferences that people will actually wear
