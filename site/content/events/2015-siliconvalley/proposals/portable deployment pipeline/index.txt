title: "portable deployment pipeline"
---

**Abstract:**
Walter (github.com/walter-cd/walter) is a tiny tool for executing
deployment pipelines (such as automated build workflows) in Continuous
Integration / Delivery (CI / CD).

When managing a CI environment with Jenkins, we commonly use some sort of
build pipeline plugins such as build pipeline-plugin to define deployment
flows and execute the tasks in the flow one by one.

Although these Jenkins plugins are useful to manage and control CI, we
still have the following problems in the deployment of our services.

- None of us is able to run build pipeline without our Jenkins server
- No one is able to check if the pipeline works until starting the CI
jobs in the Jenkins server
- We feel the difficulties to migrate the build pipeline settings to
other CI environments

Although we have built our system that maintains the servers settings
with configuration files of Chef or Ansible in the Git repositories, only
the deployment pipeline settings are still in Jenkins server… Of course
Modern CI services such as Travis-ci or Wercker provide the solution to
this problem. Unfortunately, we can’t execute these services locally.

To manage the deployment settings with the local repositories, we have
developed a tiny deployment workflow engine in Golang.

At DevOpsDays, I would like to talk about how walter solves the problems
around the deployment systems. The session also covers use cases of
walter in the combination with other tools such as Docker. ref:
