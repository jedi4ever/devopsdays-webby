**Abstract:**

To be honest I could definitely do a full-length presentation on the matter, but it'd probably be meatier if condensed down into an Ignite.

The gist of it is that I have worked in the tech sector for about 10 years in various roles (most recently, a comedy writer) and found myself writing marketing copy for a popular DevOps software company. It's been a pretty interesting ride and I think I have some really honest and unique "outsider-but-insider" observations I can share about the movement.
