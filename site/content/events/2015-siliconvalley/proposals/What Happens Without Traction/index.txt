title: "What Happens Without Traction?"
---

**Abstract:**

What if you're not the CTO and you want to improve your quality, performance and stability?
This is my story of working within low buy-in, legacy, siloed organizations to break down barriers, blur borders and eliminate constraints.

Weâ€™ll cover:
- tribes and guilds vs silos and departments
- easy wins
- low impact tools
- talking the talk and walking the walk
- trust and building confidence

Audience:
The new, cautious or the jaded tech professional

What you get:
Clear guidance on navigating a corporate nightmare to make progress with DevOps, and the right steps to take if you're past the point of trying.
