title: "Technical Dive into Container Interoperability with Live Demo of Containers on Azure"
---

**Abstract:**

How do you build a container service that supports both interoperability and the latest and greatest tools in the space?

Interoperability is achieved through standardization of the interfaces between products. In its most rigid form this requires all parties to agree, through a formal standards body, on the “one true way” so that products and tools from different vendors work well together. This interoperability is good for users as it provides choice and flexibility. However, a need to align ones interfaces with others in the market can slow innovation since innovation requires parties to push beyond the status quo in the pursuit of technical advancement and efficiency. There is, therefore, a tension between interoperability and innovation.When building services in areas of rapid innovation, as is the case in the field of DevOps, this tension needs to be effectively managed.

In this session we will look at a layered approach to building a container service on Azure cloud. The goal is to provide maximum flexibility at each layer while enabling users to standardize at each layer as innovation starts to slow and standardization emerges. We will look at the container focused open source ecosystem, how key parts of this ecosystem are leveraging standardization
techniques and what a layered container service might look like in order to take advantage of this standardization whilst still supporting innovation in key areas. This presentation will be co presented by a leading open source developer on the Microsoft Azure team along with one of the leading industry Devops and Docker evangelists from Docker.
