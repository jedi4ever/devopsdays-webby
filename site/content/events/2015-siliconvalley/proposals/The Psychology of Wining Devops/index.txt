title: "The Psychology of Wining Devops"
---

**Abstract:**

The intersection of multiple skillets and environments affords the great opportunity for those that want to empower and build with a team. This talk shares some of my lessons learned from working in the trenches and the psychology that lays behind the patterns that make Devops ridiculously fun.
