**Abstract:**

After almost 20 years as a sysadmin, working for myself, in the enterprise, and for startups, I had a problem: I viewed vendors as the enemy.
So I went to work for a tools vendor as a traveling consultant.

The story of an ongoing quest to understand all the humans across the different groups in the industry, and what I learned along the way.
