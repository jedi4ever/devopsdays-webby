title: "How to handle incidents, downtime and outages"
---

**Abstract:**

100% uptime is impossible. Modern architectures are
designed around failure but what does that mean for the human aspect
of incident management? This talk will consider how to prepare for
outages, how to structure the response, and how those experiences and
techniques differ for small and large companies.

Key topics will include:

* On call - rotations, scheduling, systems and policies
* Preparing for downtime - teams, systems and product architecture
* Documentation
* Checklists and playbooks
* How we actually handle incidents
* Post mortems

This is a more formal talk based off a discussion session I ran with a
couple of engineers from Yelp
