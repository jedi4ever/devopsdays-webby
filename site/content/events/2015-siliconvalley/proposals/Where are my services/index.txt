title: "Where are my services?"

**Abstract:**

Service discovery is the glue that ties together any large scale Service Oriented Architecture, yet the tradeoffs between the various approaches have received relatively little attention.

Here at .... we've built a service discovery using SmartStack, Apache ZooKeeper and HAProxy.  We'll describe some of the lessons that we've learned during the process.  Specific topics include:

* Why not just use DNS or Amazon Elastic Load Balancing?
* How to define a configuration language for service discovery that any developer can use
* How to perform service discovery between datacenters
* How to safely deploy changes to service discovery code
* Tradeoffs between CP and AP for discovery data
* Scaling challenges
