---

**Abstract:**

In this session, we will explore the value of Kibana 4 for log analysis and will give a real live, hands-on tutorial on how to set up Kibana 4 and get the most out of Apache log files. We will examine three use cases: IT operations, business intelligence, and security and compliance. This is a hands-on session which will require participants to bring their own laptops, and we will provide the rest.
