title: "Avoiding the Process Event Horizon"
---

**Abstract:**

This talk covers how as organizations grow, the need for process is perceived to grow also. However, to people with 0 process, even lightweight process seems heavy handed. Past a certain point, reducing process is impossible as even a lighter weight process seems like anarchy.  I will touch on who to listen to, how to drive correctly and avoid this gravity well
