## Getting to Pittsburgh

* **Driving** - Pittsburgh has its navigational challenges, but following signs for **Oakland** and **University of Pittsburgh** will put you in the right place.
* **Flying** - We recommend flying into PIT and taking a [28X Airport Express bus](http://www.portauthority.org/paac/SchedulesMaps/AirportService.aspx) into Oakland. PAT bus fare is $3.75 for this trip. Some southeast origin cities might be cheaper to fly into LBE in Latrobe and rent a car for the ~70 minute drive to Pittsburgh.
* **Train** - Pittsburgh has an AMTRAK station downtown. Taking a 71 or 61 bus from 5th Ave, a [short walk](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Amtrak+Station+-+PGH,+The+Pennsylvanian:+Management+Office,+1100+Liberty+Ave,+Pittsburgh,+PA+15222/The+Historic+William+Pitt+Union,+3959+Fifth+Avenue,+Pittsburgh,+PA+15213/@40.4417928,-79.9939852,16z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x8834f1589fe2b1bf:0x6dffce30c7354135!2m2!1d-79.992172!2d40.444117!1m5!1m1!1s0x8834f22977be23ad:0xa23362b276252831!2m2!1d-79.954796!2d40.443468!3e3) from the station, will get you into Oakland.
