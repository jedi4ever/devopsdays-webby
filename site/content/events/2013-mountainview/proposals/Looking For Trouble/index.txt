title: "Looking for Trouble: How to rapidly diagnose and solve crazy problems when time matters"
---

**Abstract:**
 
This talk will be about how to troubleshoot and resolve problems in
your infrastructure when you're under the gun.  It has occurred to me
that a lot of junior people lack any framework from which to
troubleshoot problems that happen in their infrastructure, whether in
a crisis or just things that are happening on a regular basis.  Most
people are content with doing one of the 3 Rs (Restart, Reload,
Reboot) but this generally makes the 4th R (the most important one)
Root Cause, impossible to perform.  I will talk about the attitude
that you have to have, provide you with a methodology and some actual
tools to start you on your journey  from Padawan to Jedi as far as
troubleshooting issues are concerned.

**Speaker:**

My first job out of college was writing CPU and device diagnostics in
PDP-11 Assembler.  This probably coloured my outlook on Software
Engineering and Systems in general... trust but verify. Over the
years, I've been a developer in Assembler, C, C++ and now Python. Also
did a stint as a Sr. Business Critical Support Engineer for Enterprise
Products at VMware and Nicira.  I currently have the title of Sr.
DevOps Engineer at StubHub/EBay where I push  virtual StubHub
environments to Dev teams for a living.
