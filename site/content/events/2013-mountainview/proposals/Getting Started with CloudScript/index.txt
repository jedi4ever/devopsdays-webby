title: "Getting Started with CloudScript"
---

**Abstract:**

CloudScript is a build language for the NephoScale cloud computing
platform.  It is an external DSL with a dependency based programming
model that supports idempotent operations on all resource types.  It
allows embedded code to be run as scripts and recipes on instantiated
servers, and the execution engine processes recipe callbacks from
distributed agents allowing for complex automation workflows, such as
Application Stacks, Distributed Systems/Clusters, Environmental
Scaling, Business Process Automation, and Data Pipeline Automation.

**Speaker:**

Nick Peterson Director of Engineering at Nephoscale
