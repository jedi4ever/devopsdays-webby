title: "Managerial  Mindset: Change It or Game Over!"
---

**Abstract:**

In the DevOps community we talk a lot about “culture”—describing it,
changing it, and living in it.  In many cases, our ability to embrace
and implement DevOps is largely a function of whether or not our
“culture” will support it.  We say our culture “sucks” or is “awesome”
because of what we can or cannot do.  What we don’t realize is that
culture is just a manifestation of behavior that is the by-product of
the organization’s mindset. Ultimately, mindset is implemented and
enforced by managers and managerial systems so what do you do? Without
managers’ thought processes changing transformational efforts will
fail as the prevailing mindset will drive behaviors of staff back to
their “safe place.”  DevOps, Agile, Lean, Continuous Delivery and
other good stuff are eventually doomed unless the mindset changes.

 
This talk will discuss how to implement transformation by changing
mindset, specifically in management. How do you do it? What mindset
elements do you need to change? How hard is it?  What about large
organizations?  What about startups or companies that have been around
for years?  I will discuss key ideas and recommend specific actions
based on my experience as a change agent working at the company that
moved from a “traditional” operations and development mindset to one
of business agility.
