title: The Devops Journey that Transformed REA
---

**Abstract:**

REA group, which runs between others [realestate.com.au](realestate.com.au), [casa.it](casa.it) and
[athome.lu](athome.lu) websites focused on realestate advertising in different
countries, has been involved in an interesting transformation process
following the Devops principles in the last years that has changed
completely the way we face operations.

From completed isolated worlds, delivery and operations, to a much
more efficient approach which continues to evolve every day in this
talk we will cover some of the key elements for this transformation
including cultural and technical aspects that helped us during the
journey and which ones made it hard.
