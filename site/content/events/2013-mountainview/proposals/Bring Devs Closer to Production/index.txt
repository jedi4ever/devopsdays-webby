title: "Bring Devs Closer to Production"
---

**Abstract:**

"If we're deploying to CentOS, why are devs running the app on OS X?"

We strive to create shared environments which mirror Production as
closely as possible. At the same time it's not uncommon for a
developer's workstation environment to be very far from Production. In
this talk we'll learn how teams can pull production-like environments
all the way back to a developer's workstation while still remaining
productive, using tools like Vagrant and Chef.

We'll also share some of the benefits we see for teams that do this.
The whole team gain a better understanding of how their system
operates 'for real'. Everyone is empowered to make infra and config
changes when everyone's local development environment is as useful for
testing infrastructure changes as code changes. New team members and
members of other teams can setup their own personal copy of the system
in minutes.

**Speaker:**

Pete is a lead consultant at ThoughtWorks based in SF, where he has
spent a fair amount of time helping build CD pipelines which stretch
from ideas to production. His recent interests include
using tools to help devs embrace infrastructure as a key part of
their app.
