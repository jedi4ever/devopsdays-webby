title: Building cross region and cross cloud high availability into your app
---

**Abstract:**

A real life case: Achieving high levels of availability and disaster
recovery in a cloud environment requires the implementation of
patterns and practices that introduce redundancy through multi-zone,
multi-region, and multi-cloud deployments. As we move towards
implementing higher availability, we cannot escape the direct increase
in the accidental complexity of the deployment architecture resulting
from lack of cloud portability and deployment lifecycle automation. We
present a solution approach implemented by a real-world user for
achieving high availability and disaster recovery using the Cloudify
open source framework. This approach applies to not just AWS, but also
other public clouds and private cloud environments such as Eucalyptus.
The resulting reference architecture provides portable PostgreSQL
replication and disaster recovery as well as application tier
scalability across zones, regions, and public/private clouds through a
unified deployment workflow.
