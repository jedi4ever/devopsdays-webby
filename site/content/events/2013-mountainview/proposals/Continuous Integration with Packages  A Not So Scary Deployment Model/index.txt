title: "Continuous Integration with Packages - A Not So Scary Deployment Model"
---

**Abstract:**

Packages aren't just for SysAdmin's anymore! The days of deploying
code via rsync and tarballs are over. Lets have a talk about how you
can use open source tools to build reliable, continuous code
deployment models. We'll walk through creating packages with FPM,
building repositories with PRM and using Jenkins to make your workflow
as simple as a click of a button. By leveraging open source tools such
as Jenkins, FPM and PRM you can create an excellent recipe for your
deployment process. We will learn how packages and package
repositories can be utilized for continuous deployment, using examples
and lessons that we have learned at DreamHost.  We'll also review why
packages are an excellent tool in deployment and some of their
drawbacks.

**Speaker:**

Brett Gailey - Senior Systems Engineer, DreamHost. His role at
DreamHost asks him to automate anything and everything that has to do
with Operations.
