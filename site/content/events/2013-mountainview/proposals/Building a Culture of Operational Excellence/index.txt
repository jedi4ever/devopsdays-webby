title: "Building a Culture of Operational Excellence"
---

**Abstract:**

Description: For many companies, Software Operations is something that
is kept completely separate from Software Development. Now, with
infrastructure automation frameworks blurring the lines between what
is Software Operations and Development, how do teams decide on who
owns what? How do teams not end up pointing the finger at each other
when something breaks? In this talk, we'll focus on some of the
tactics and strategies used in getting teams to work better together
and helping engineers think of Operational Excellence with every line
of code written.

**Speaker:**

Arup Chakrabarti, the Operations Engineering Team Lead at PagerDuty
