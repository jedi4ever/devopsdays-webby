title: "Start Social Ops"
---

**Abstract:**

Description: DevOps is very focused on tools and automation and methodologies often assume a certain infrastructure size. However, nothing starts that way and humans are involved in every step. Provisioning your first instance as a bootstrapped founder is very different from having a team on call 24/7 responsible for complex components running the world.

This talk will start at the beginning examining how to run your infrastructure as a single founder, and how that team scales over time. It will consider social aspects such as on-call schedules, technical handoffs and correct procedures as well as exploring the tools that make this possible.
It will include some interesting war stories as well as tips and suggestions for how to run ops at a startup.
