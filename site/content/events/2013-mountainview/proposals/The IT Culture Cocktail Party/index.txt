title: "The IT Culture Cocktail Party – DevOps, ITSM, Agile and Technology"
---

**Abstract:**
 
IT is actually a multi-cultural society comprised of different
factions, each advocating for their favorite framework, methodology,
technology or philosophy.   Culture clashes can range from denial,
silo isolation and the most unfortunate “them vs us” mentalities.
But not surprisingly, each faction has the same end-game: high quality
services that meet business needs at the right time and the right
cost.  So if everyone is celebrating at the same party, why then is
there still such a cultural divide?
 
This presentation examines each culture and discusses ways to
recognize and leverage cultural similarities, embrace the differences
and cultivate the best of each in order to build a positive,
productive and proud culture that is uniquely your own.

While this will start as a presentation, I think it would be awesome
to get some audience participation, first by polling for the types of
frameworks/cultures in place in their organization and then perhaps
inviting some people to the stage “party panel” to see if we can get
them to share some thoughts and even acknowledge some alignment.
