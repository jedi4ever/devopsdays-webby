title: Going All-In with Vagrant
---

**Abstract:**

Lightning Talk / Ignite

With the introduction of provider plugins, Vagrant can now go far
beyond just managing desktop VirtualBox environments. This talk will
describe how a large enterprise made Vagrant the center of the entire
continuous delivery lifecycle, even to the point of running Vagrant
from inside itself.
