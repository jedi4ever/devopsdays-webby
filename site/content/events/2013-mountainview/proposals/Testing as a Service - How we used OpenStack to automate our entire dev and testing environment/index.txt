title: Testing as a Service - How we used OpenStack to automate our entire dev and testing environment
---

**Abstract:**

Building and testing distributed software platforms can be a tedious
and daunting task. Achieving good coverage can be very hard since a
lot of factors affect the overall testability and coverage of a
system.  Some problems only become apparent on a distributed setup,
such as timing and network issues, etc. In this session we’ll explain
how we used OpenStack and Cloudify to implement and automate real
integration testing (as in, no mocks) for our entire product suite,
and how we significantly improved our overall coverage and
reliability.
