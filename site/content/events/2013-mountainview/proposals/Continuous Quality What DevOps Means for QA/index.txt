title: "Continuous Quality: What DevOps Means for QA"
---

**Abstract:**

DevOps and Continuous Delivery drive dramatic shifts in the roles,
perspectives, and skill sets of QA Engineers. They must become
software engineers in their own right. At the same time, they need the
ability to understand and validate operational concerns such as
security, scalability, resilience, etc. In a software-as-service
world, QA's ultimate job is to help DevOps organizations understand
the customer's job-to-be-done and ensure they satisfy customers' needs
for deliverability and serviceability.


This talk will provide a detailed introduction to the new role of QA
within DevOps. It will describe testing tools and techniques
applicable to Continuous Delivery. It will also explore ways that QA
can help connect Dev and Ops more directly to the business and to the
customer.
