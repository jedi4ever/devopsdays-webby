title: "DevOps for Security: Automation is your only hope to protect Cloud IaaS"
---

**Abstract:**

Enterprises today are adopting the cloud in all shapes and sizes:
public, private, hybrid, even (cloud)washed. For some security teams
this is a nightmare, but that won’t stop the business from moving
ahead because on-demand computing simply helps improve business
agility too much.

There is hope though. Whether you are building applications in public
CSPs (Amazon EC2/VPC, Rackspace Cloud, etc), private
infrastructure-as-a-service (OpenStack, CloudStack, VMware even) the
security controls you care about are the same, but they way they need
to be deployed and run is very very different.

DevOps teams have fallen in love with automation tools like Chef,
Puppet, and others, but how can security teams leverage automation to
improve their life? How do we let the business realize the promise of
fully automated self-service provisioning of resources by end users,
while keeping our necessary controls in place and ensuring continuous
compliance?

In this session, Rand Wacker (VP of Product for CloudPassage) will
share experience learned from some of the largest and most advanced
organizations in the world as they have pioneered the cloud security
automation trail.


Please join us to learn and discuss:
·   	Why the DevOps, Marketing, and BU teams love cloud, and where adoption is going
·   	How security must re-think their approach to enable the business to get the most out of IaaS, in both public and private environments
·   	Who is responsible for cloud security, both in your org as well as with your providers
·   	What it takes to maintain security visibility and compliance in a self-service world
·   	When you can expect your org to be using cloud resources that aren’t adequately secured (spoiler alert: its probably already happening)

**Speaker:**

Andrew Hay Director of Applied Security Research CloudPassage Inc.
