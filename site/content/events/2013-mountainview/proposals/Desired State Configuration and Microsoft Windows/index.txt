title: "Desired State Configuration and Microsoft Windows"
---

**Abstract:**

In this talk I will present an overview of how Windows management fits into the Desired State landscape illustrating how industry standards and open protocols can be used to extend the Desired State ecosystem to include Windows devices. The long-term vision for this architecture centers around creating a universal automation layer that can (eventually) extend to all devices in the infrastructure.
