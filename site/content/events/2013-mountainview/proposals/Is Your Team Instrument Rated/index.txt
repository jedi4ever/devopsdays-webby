title: "Is Your Team Instrument Rated (or: Deploying 89,000 times a day)"
---

**Abstract:**
 
As DevOps matures from craft, through trade, to a science, we are starting
to work on distilling out how we can make DevOps' implementation and the
organizational transformation repeatable and predictable, across all kinds of
environments. As part of that search, it is time to start looking at
humanity's other "operational" endeavors and see what is applicable to DevOps.

This talk examines one of the largest operational systems built to
date: the national airspace system. We will look at specific aspects of how
controllers (operations teams) work with pilots (developers) to safely move
millions of passengers (customers) every year, with an incident rate that
would make any development shop jealous.

In aviation, harsher, more crowded, and inclement conditions all require
additional training: an instrument rating. Similarly, developers and
operations teams buying in to "DevOps culture" is a great start, but it's
often hard to nail down what that actually means.  We'll examine the specific
behavioral and operational elements of this other complex system that has
been tamed and look at what's applicable to implementing a DevOps culture
within our own industry.

Finally, we'll examine some of aviation's hard-learned lessons, and look at
ways we can leverage this knowledge, and avoid those classes of pitfalls.
