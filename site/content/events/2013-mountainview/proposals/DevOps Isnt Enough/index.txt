title: "DevOps Isn’t Enough"
---

**Abstract:**

The values and ideas espoused by the DevOps movement are great, but by
itself isn’t enough. That should be obvious because it is just Dev &
Ops, right?  Frankly, DevOps is just a piece of a bigger puzzle that
needs to be put together to form a whole picture. The same goes for
Agile development—not enough.  We now have the Lean Startup and
LeanUX.  We have technologies and practices like the Cloud and
Continuous Delivery.  By themselves none of these are enough!  They
address only a part of the required transformation. To really be
successful, companies and organizations need to adopt a holistic
approach to create an organization that can sense, adapt, learn, and
respond like a living, sentient entity.

 
The key to a holistic approach is creating a focus on customer
purpose.  All activities and organizational units must contribute to
the creation of customer value and success. Without the proper
orientation towards the customer each part of the organization will
perform sub-optimally and could even unwittingly hurt overall efforts.

 
This talk will discuss how to align to our customer’s purpose (the
REAL customer) and how to pull all of these related “agile ideas” into
a complete, working, value creating organization.
