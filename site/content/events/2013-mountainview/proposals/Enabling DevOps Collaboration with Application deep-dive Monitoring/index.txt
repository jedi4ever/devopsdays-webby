title: "Enabling DevOps Collaboration with Application deep-dive Monitoring"
---

**Abstract:**

You have probably mastered the art of doing Agile releases by
automating release processes and employing application release
automation tools. However not having proper application performance
monitoring tools in production makes you blind to how your newly
deployed source code is impacting end-users. And the part of the
application that is spoiling the Release celebration beer is
invisible! Come and learn how you can use application performance
monitoring tools to enable DevOps collaboration. This will provide you
with 20/20 visibility to the impact of new releases on application
performance. You will gain visibility into which users are getting
impacted, which lines of the code are causing grief. I will take
examples of two organizations (a Payroll processing company and a
Healthcare company) and will show how they have improved DevOps
collaboration with application performance monitoring tool.
