title: "DevOps+Agile=Business Transformation"
---

**Abstract:**

The new world order of business is increasingly centered on the speed in
which an organization can leverage digital commerce to rapidly deliver goods
and services to consumers.  This movement was ignited by the success of
companies such as Amazon and Google – who are disrupting traditional
businesses by serving consumers better and faster with innovative
technology.

To move at this kind of speed, businesses must transform.  This means IT
needs to be a front office strategic imperative to business and not the back
office support system for internal operations. The reality today is that
separation between Dev and Ops in large organizations still reigns supreme.
We all know this has to change.

In the Ops world many of us seeDevOps as the future.  Our developer brethren
think about Agile development practices and moving from multi-month (or
year!) development cycles to short sprints.  We are all really talking about
the same thing.  Breaking down organizational boundary’s and  integrating
teams to move faster.  Then integrating tool chains so that we have common
tooling and don’t need to hand off artifacts (see CODE!) and continuously
delivering innovation for the business.  There is a process for making this
transition and that we here at Opscode have seen in practice.  Adam
will talk about the 5 key drivers of success in making that
transition.

Warning - business transformation is not for the light of heart!
