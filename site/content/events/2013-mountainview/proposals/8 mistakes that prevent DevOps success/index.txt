title: "8 mistakes that prevent DevOps success"
---

**Abstract:**

Based on my article published on CM Crossroads <http://www.cmcrossroads.com/article/eight-mistakes-prevent-devops-success>

 I've seen several problem in companies over the years that I believe are significant.  Besides cultural challenges, there are technical challenges that are not specific to any tool chain that need to be addressed in order for a DevOps initiative to scale beyond the scope of a small team.  I will also cover that while a technology first approach to DevOps with a coalition of the willing may make a successful proof of concept project, cultural issues need to be addressed too.
