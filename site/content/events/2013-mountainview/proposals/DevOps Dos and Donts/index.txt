title: "DevOps Do's and Don'ts"

**Abstract:**

Salesforce has been undergoing a (sometimes painful) DevOps transformation
for almost a year now.   Along the way we have had a number of successes,
and a number of failures.   I'm proposing an ignite talk in the style of
Todd Parr's "Do's and Don'ts" and "Underwear Do's and DonÂ¹t's"
(http://www.amazon.com/dp/0316908061/ref=rdr_ext_tmb) books for 3 year
olds.    With the 20 slides, we can cover up to 20 best/worst suggestions
for practicing DevOps.

Example:  

DO:  Adopt the CAMS model for explaining to your executives and others why
we're doing what we're doing and what are the components of a successful
transformation

DON'T: Worry about the tooling when you could be worrying about the
culture.   Cultural change is what it takes to be successful in your
transformation and at a big company like salesforce.com, cultural change
is HARD.  (plus, you might make John Willis take his C from the model and
go home)


DO: Get the Ops team involved early in the process.   DevOps needs to be
driven by and participated in by both organizations.   If one side is
preaching to the other, you won't have DevOps and you will probably be in
worse shape than when you started.

DON'T:  Get Ops involved earlier by allowing them to create a "Front Door
Process" where you need to fill out a form when you start on any
development project and submit that to Ops to get their approval (yes,
this actually happened)!
