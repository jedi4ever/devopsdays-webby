title: Continuous Delivery with Jenkins and Cloudify (FastConnect)
---

**Abstract:**

Continuous delivery is not an option anymore for organizations and
companies that implement online services and products. The ability to
rollout new code changes quickly and as frequently as needed is an
important business enabler. In this session weâ€™ll review the current
options for CD in the cloud, and learn how to implement an automated
CD process using Cloudify and Jenkins.


**Speaker:**

Uri Cohen heads the Product and Developer community efforts at GigaSpaces,
and is a frequent speaker at various industry events and meetups. Most
recently, Uri co-organized the first DevOps conference in Israel. Uri
has spoken at QCon New York, Cassandra Summit, CloudStack
Collaboration Conference, QCon London, QCon San Francisco, CloudBeat
and Devoxx, among others.
