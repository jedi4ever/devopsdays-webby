title: Make Ned Scale! How Private PaaS Can Scale Management in a World of Limitless Virtualization
---

**Abstract:**

Virtualization promises the world: So convenient! So effortless! So
affordable! Think of all those limitless resources, all abstracted
away. Then think of all the applications and data that will reside on
(and eventually extend) those abstracted resources. While VMs offer
the convenience of easily-provisioned scalability, they don’t exactly
make life easier for Ned in IT, who has to manage all those
easy-to-deploy applications. But that’s where private PaaS can help.
In this presentation and demo, an ActiveState technical leader will
discuss the practical challenges of deploying cloud applications, and
how private PaaS can constructively let Ned “scale” to manage his
growing cloud of apps and data.

**Speaker:**

John Wetherill, developer evangelist and a Java expert at AcitveState
