**Abstract:**

Skybox Imaging (Skybox) provides easy access to reliable and frequent
high-resolution satellite imagery and HD video of the earth by
combining the power of web technologies and a constellation of
microsatellites.

Skybox's infrastructure allows us to automate configuration,
deployment and management of Remote Ground Stations, the Mission
Operations Centers, and Hadoop Image Processing platform. We deploy
across multiple security zones and continents. Our applications are
developed using diverse programming languages and architectures.

We manage configuration using Puppet and Hiera. We deploy, activate
and rollback with multiple parallel installs. Development and
Operations teams use agile techniques like TDD and Continuous
Deployment. Our Puppet configurations are test-driven and deployed
automatically when we check in changes.

In this talk, you'll learn about how we overcame the challenges
imposed by our unique set of requirements. You'll see our innovative
blend of CD, TDD and configuration management. All this can only
happen through collaboration between Development and TechOps.
