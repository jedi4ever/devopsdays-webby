### The event will consist entirely of open spaces. 

The theme for this devopsdays is: the practice of devops.

We've heard quite a bit about the theory of devops, and theory is important. We've heard about the potential benefits of devops. We'd now like to hear from the practitioners of devops: what is the devops, as you practice it? what do you differently with devops? what doesn't work as well as advertised? what's harder or easier with devops? what are the surprises that come out of devops practice? 
 
You may prepare materials (e.g., presentations or demos) ahead of time, and propose them for consideration for one of the open spaces.
