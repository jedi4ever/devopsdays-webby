                From fledgling startups to established industry, the Midwest is home to a large, vibrant technology
                community. Ohio in particular has been a flurry of activity in the past several years, drawing attention
                from around the globe.
                <br/><br/>
                DevOpsDays Ohio will bring 300+ development, infrastructure, operations, InfoSec, management and
                leadership professionals together to discuss the culture and tools to make better organizations and
                products.
                <br/><br/>
                The event's schedule will consist of a mixture of single-track presentations, Ignite Talks, and the
                "open space" format that DevOpsDays is known for.
