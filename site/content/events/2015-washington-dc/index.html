## The Ayes Have It - DevOpsDays DC is a wrap!

The inaugural DevOpsDays DC is in the books, and was a resounding success.
**THANK YOU** to everyone who helped made it happen - our partners at
the USPTO, all of our sponsors, our talented and engaging speakers,
dedicated volunteers and organizers, and most importantly our 400+
attendees from the private and public sectors and everywhere in between.

A special thanks to everyone who attended for helping us
provide a harassment-free conference experience
for _everyone_. Our [code of conduct](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2015-washington-dc/conduct/)
was understood and respected, and we greatly appreciate it! If you do
have any comments or complaints after the fact, please let the organizers
know (see the bottom of the conduct page.)

Much as _some people_ are preparing for next year, so are we. With
DevOpsDays DC 2015 such a great event, how could we not do it again
in 2016? Stay tuned in the coming months for more details. In the
meantime, if you're looking for more DevOpsDays, there are
[several upcoming events](http://www.devopsdays.org/) in both CONUS
and OCONUS - road trip!

## About Washington, DC

If all you know of Washington, DC is what you see on C-SPAN or _House of Cards_,
you're missing out. While its importance as the Nation's Capital and center of
government is undisputed, the "DMV" (District, Maryland, and Virginia) is also home
to innovative startups, leading universities, and world-class arts and culture.

If you're local, you already know the diversity of our DevOps community. If you're
coming in from elsewhere, prepare to mix with DevOps leaders from every segment of
our vibrant local scene. And, of course, take some time to check out everything else
the Nation's Capital has to offer, from the many free Smithsonian museums to great
food and drink!

For those coming from out of town, there are flights from just about everywhere to
our three local airports, and there are several hotels nearby. More details
are on the [location page](location).
