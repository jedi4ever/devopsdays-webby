## About Washington, DC

If all you know of Washington, DC is what you see on C-SPAN or _House of Cards_,
you're missing out. While its importance as the Nation's Capital and center of
government is undisputed, the "DMV" (District, Maryland, and Virginia) is also home
to innovative startups, leading universities, and world-class arts and culture.

If you're local, you already know the diversity of our DevOps community. If you're
coming in from elsewhere, prepare to mix with DevOps leaders from every segment of
our vibrant local scene. And, of course, take some time to check out everything else
the Nation's Capital has to offer, from the many free Smithsonian museums to great
food and drink!

For those coming from out of town, there are flights from just about everywhere to
our three local airports, and we have a hotel deal for you. More details
are on the [location page](location).
