The DevOpsDays DC team urges you to take [Metro](http://www.wmata.com/)
to the event. USPTO is located a few blocks from the [King Street/Old
Town](http://www.wmata.com/rail/station_detail.cfm?station_id=48)
station, which is served by Blue and Yellow line trains.
It's also a short ride from [National Airport
(DCA)](http://www.metwashairports.com/reagan/reagan.htm), our recommended
airport for visitors from out of town. If you're arriving at Dulles
(IAD), Baltimore (BWI), or Amtrak's Union Station, Metro's
[trip planner](http://wmata.com/rider_tools/tripplanner/tripplanner_form_solo.cfm)
can help you get to the event.

DC and Northern Virginia traffic is consistently rated among the worst
in the nation, so we recommend that you do not drive, especially if you
are visiting from out of town. If you must drive, please see [USPTO's
directions page](http://www.uspto.gov/about/contacts/locations/directions.jsp).
