# What DevOps is Not

*Leon Fayer, Vice President, OmniTI ([@papa_fire](https://twitter.com/papa_fire))*

DevOps has been a hot topic in the industry for some time now. A lot of people been talking about it. Some have built business models around DevOps-related tools and themes. People have made career around talking about it. In light of all of that, I find it chuckle-worthy that very few people actually know what DevOps is (just follow #devops on Twitter for proof.) I am not going to be one of many trying to create a buzzword-infested definition of DevOps to suit my particular agenda. Instead, Iâ€™d like to demystify some of the more common misconception about what DevOps is.
