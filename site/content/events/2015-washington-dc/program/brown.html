# Vagrant for Non-Developers

*Mike Brown, Python Specialty Lead, Excella*

Vagrant helps developers minimize the difference between production and development environments. That's great for developers, but why should the rest of the team care? This talk will discuss several features of Vagrant that will increase consistency and minimize surprises throughout the deployment pipeline. The discussion will be non-technical, focusing on the value for the entire team.
