# DevOops &amp; How I hacked you

*Ken Johnson, CTO, nVisium ([@cktricky](http://twitter.com/cktricky))*

*Chris Gates, Security Engineer, Facebook ([@carnal0wnage](http://twitter.com/carnal0wnage))*

In a quest to move faster, organizations can end up creating security vulnerabilities using the tools and products meant to protect them. Both Chris Gates and Ken Johnson will share their collaborative research into the technology driving DevOps as well as share their stories of what happens when these tools are used insecurely as well as when the tools are just insecure.

Technologies discussed will encompass AWS Technology, Chef, Puppet, Hudson/Jenkins, Vagrant, Kickstart and much, much more. This talk will most definitely be an entertaining one but a cautionary tale as well, provoking attendees into action. Ultimately, this is research targeted towards awareness for those operating within a DevOps environment.
