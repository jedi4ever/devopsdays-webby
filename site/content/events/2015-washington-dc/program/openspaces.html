# Introduction to Open Spaces

*Nathen Harvey, DevOpsDays DC Chair and Community Director, Chef ([@nathenharvey](https://twitter.com/nathenharvey))*

The afternoon is a facilitated Open Space event. During this time we'll create the agenda for the afternoon.

There are several desired outcomes of the open spaces:

1. The issues that are most important to people will get discussed.
1. The issues raised will be addressed by the participants best capable of getting something done about them.
1. All of the most important ideas, recommendations, discussions, and next steps will be documented in a report.
1. When sufficient time is allowed, the report contents will be prioritized by the group.
1. Participants will feel engaged and energized by the process.
