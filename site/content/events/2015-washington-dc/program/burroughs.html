# Effective Infrastructure Code Review

*Chris Burroughs, AddThis ([@csby54](https://twitter.com/csby54))*

Once infrastructure becomes code it becomes testable as code (testing is generally considered a pretty good idea). It also becomes reviewable as code. Code review is a powerful complement to testing (and might just be the more effective of the two for finding bugs), spreading knowledge, and improving at the craft of programming

In this talk:

* Be convinced reviewing code review is also a pretty good idea.
* Cover pre and post commit workflows and example tooling to make your day better.
* Lessons from the messy growing pains of growing an organization from virtually no formal code review to reviewing every commit.
* Best practices for being an effective reviewer and reviewee.
