# Getting the Message Out in the (Big, Bad, Government) Enterprise

*Drew Malone, Developer, Fledgling SRE, Cloudera*

Or, "Automation is hard and the enterprise is large."

Fewer steps, decreased time-to-production, faster iteration cycles... Devops practically sells itself - except when it doesn't. You can do all the right things but if you don't make it matter for Mission(tm), nobody will listen. We're very good at the first step toward excellence (doing great things) but we often forget about the follow-up - talk about it. But how? Where? Changing culture isn't easy, especially when you're a single person inside a huge government organization. We'll show a few tips we've learned along our journey toward making government work a little less painful. Speed of government? Red tape? Legions of bureaucrats with nothing better to do than slow you down? We know your pain. We're here to help.
