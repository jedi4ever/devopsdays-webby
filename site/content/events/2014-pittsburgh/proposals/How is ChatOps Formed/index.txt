title: "How is ChatOps Formed?"
---

**Abstract:**

Chatops, as defined by Webster's New World Dictionary, is doing your DevOps through chat. In this talk, you will learn the 2 Ws of Chatops: Why and How.

Why Chatops?

* It centralizes information in useful ways
* It democratizes DevOps, giving anyone the power and confidence to do your job for you
* It's way more fun than the terminal

How Chatops?

* Use OSS Hubot and hubot-scripts (Thanks Github!)
* Write your own plugins for company-specific commands and metrics
* Start with the one thing that people bug you the most to do
* Then listen to your users, they'll tell you ("Wouldn't it be cool if the bot did X?")
* Refine the interactions to have a high signal-to-noise ratio
