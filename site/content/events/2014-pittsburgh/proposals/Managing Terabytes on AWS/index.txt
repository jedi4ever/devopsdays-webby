title: "Managing Terabytes on AWS"
---

**Abstract:**

JFrog is handling huge amount of binaries files for all our customers. Since each customer has its own space and domain, using a global Object Store can be tricky.

Also our application cannot work with an "eventually consistent" storage, and cannot deliver customer requirements with current S3 performance.

Learn in this session how we managed fast upload, critical replication and backups, and global download availability of the terabytes of JFrog customer binaries files.
