title: "Particle - A compelling alternative to Cloud Formation"
---

**Abstract:**

We loved AWS CloudFormation, until we actually started to work with it. The idea that one could write a machine environment specification, then use that as a template for similar ones, was really compelling. But as our eyes started bleeding working with JSON and AWS's auto-generated naming, we determined there had to be a better way to specify AWS machine environments. Hence, cloud-particle, a Python (boto) tool for AWS environment creation, update, deletion and validation. All based on human-readable YAML specifications.

Cloud-particle will be open-sourced by AudaxHealth before DevOpsDaysPgh, and should provide a useful tool for anyone needing a lightweight tool to manage various environments in AWS.
