title: "Why Analytics Fail"
---

**Abstract:**
Are you plagued by false alerts?  Is your monitoring system asleep at the
switch when real “situations” occur?  Do you feel like your analytics are
letting your down?  This presentation explores why analytics fail; but also how
they can succeed.  Specific cases are described that are drawn from actual
(anonymized) customer data to 1) illustrate why analytics can be too noisy or
too silent and 2) identify concrete strategies for achieving (and measuring)
significant improvements in alarm quality.

The presentation is divided into
two sections.  The first talks about notorious failures with analytics and why
they happened.  The second presents several pearls of wisdom on applying
analytics successfully with insights as to why they work and real world
evidence of their value.
