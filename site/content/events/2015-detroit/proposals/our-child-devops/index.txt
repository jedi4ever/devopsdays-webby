title: "Our Child, DevOps"
---

**Abstract:**
An examination of the history and circumstances that led us here, and what it
means for business and collaboration in the future. I’ve always been fascinated
by the concept of Zugswang, and how it relates to the cost of becoming a truly
agile organization in 2015. DevOps Days tend to be overwhelmingly attended by
newcomers, and this talk will set the stage and provide context for the tools
and techniques in the program and larger scene.

We’ll cover:

- our siloed, waterfalled past
- the ‘lean’, ‘agile' future
- the cost of doing business
- what to do about it
- what works

**Audience:**
New attendees, and those looking for more context to their DevOps journey

**What you get:**
A guided tour of the history of tech, the birth of DevOps and the future of the movement

**Speaker:**
Steve Pereira, Statflo
