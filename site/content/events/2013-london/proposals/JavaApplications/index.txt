title: Java applications in DevOps world
---

**Abstract:**

If you have the background of “dynamic” languages, you might think, “what is all that fuss about developing and updating those applications running on JVM?”
In this talk, I will give a quick overview of:

* why are Java application updates harder than updates with some other technologies (e.g. PHP)
* how does that affect developer productivity (it does!)
* some solutions for overcoming these issues in development and production (e.g. rolling restart)
* different approaches to externalizing environment-specific configuration from your Java application

So, if you ever struggled maintaining Java-based applications and were not sure how to solve those issues - this talk is for you. And, even if you have not yet come across such applications, you might in the future - the Java-ecosystem is growing!

**Speaker:**

Neeme Praks
