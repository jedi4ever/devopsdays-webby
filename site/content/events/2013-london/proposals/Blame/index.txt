title: "What's really to blame? - A day in the life of your PHP app"
---

**Abstract:**

You know how to play the Blame Game when Production is broken? Probably
you have good reasons for that. Nevertheless, it's better to work out
what really went wrong - fast. See in this session how a new PHP
application can be deployed flawlessly, scaling up and down and can be
managed automatically. Discover how Dev & Ops can work together, in
concert, if the worst nightmare happens and the application breaks.


**Speaker:**

Eric Ritchie
