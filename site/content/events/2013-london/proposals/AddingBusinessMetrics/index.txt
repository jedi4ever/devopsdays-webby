title: "Adding Business Metrics"
---

**Abstract:**

Stephen Nelson-Smith's in his '6 Pillars of Monitoring' asked:
This might seem incredibly obvious - of course we monitor our systems
because downtime costs money. But if we really think like this, why are
so many of our systems so woefully monitored? And why are we not
monitoring business metrics alongside technical metrics? 

What is it that we can do to make our metrics interesting to the
business?

Approaches that we have seen used:

Lost Sales - not the actual number - but ones based on 'Typical Week' metrics:

* get the business and Devops teams to agree DevOps priorities, based on the reduction on visible measured Lost sales

Unbuyable products - products findable online but then can't be added to Basket

* Is a problem that will never go away for Travel sector
* Measuring and plotting it on wall-boards - to gain Business teams' interest

Plot Graphs that show Business Root Causes

* eg:  '3' icon to mean 'problem in 3rd party system not ours' (e.g. a CDN partner or supplier of product images etc)

'Unite the Tribes' - refer to Chris Howell's speech at Retail technology on a common metrics language

Case Study from a UK Blue Chip: there's a  couple of guys possibly
persuadable to come talk too
