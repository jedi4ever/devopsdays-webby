title: "Software Environments Management - Providing stable platforms
for delivering changes"
---

**Abstract:**

Agile software development practices, combined with an exponential
increase in the complexity of applications to be delivered have raised
the bar for stable software environments.
 
Software environments provide the platform for ensuring applications are
successfully tested and released.
 
In appropriate management of environments increases the risk of
providing test environments that are not a true reflection of the
production environment and risk compromising on the quality of testing.
 
Working in a  IT and Management consultancy, I have worked with numerous
clients and have often seen issues, which highlights the fact that test
environments are not always a true reflection of live.  But this has not
stopped us from releasing the code to live and when things go wrong (As
it so often happens), we realize that we didn’t do things right.
 
Whilst working in their own silos, dev teams work in churning code, QA
team test in a test environment, there is a clear gap wherein how do you
ensure that what is being delivered for live deployment, is tested in a
right platform?
 
Leading a DevOps team, I have regularly come across environments issues
being highlighted by various teams. In addition to environment issues,
there is a huge proliferation of tests environments. Whether you use
test environments in your local data centre or use virtual machines
spawned across cloud service providers, there is cost associated with
these. How do you manage the costs and overhead?
 
My talk highlights the importance of Environments Management. I will
introduce the concepts of environments and how it relates to various
teams (dev / qa / operations). I will walk through a suggested approach
(process, tools, dashboards)that can help organizations realize some key
benefits (such as -  delivering changes that have been tested on the
right platform, visibility of environments and their usage, etc.) and
will foster confidence across teams.
 
Key take-aways:

* Introduce the concept of environments and how it relates to – dev / qa / operations and business.
* Highlight the importance of stable environments.
* Walk through an approach (“Environments Management Process”) for identification, planning and managing environments.
* Provide suggested mechanisms for sharing information and
building confidence across teams.
