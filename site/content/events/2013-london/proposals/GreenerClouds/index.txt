title: 3 steps to move to greener, more resilient clouds
---

**Abstract:**

In this talk, I'll introduce the idea of 'clean cloud' computing, why it's interesting from a devops point of view as well as an sustainability point of view, and what steps you can take to move towards a futuristic zero carbon cloud computing infrastructure.

Why would it be interesting?

I gave a variant of this talk at LDNdevops, in London in January, which lead to some fascinating discussions afterwards at the event - as many of the steps you can take in ops are simple, and effective, and fit well into the devops worldview. 

Given many of the organisations we work for have existing climate change goals where knowledge of this would help them meet those goals with little to no cost too.

Plus, wellâ€¦ it's arguably the right thing to do as responsible adults with future generations to think about, to work out how to deliver the promises of cloud computing without it costing us a habitable  climate along the way.
