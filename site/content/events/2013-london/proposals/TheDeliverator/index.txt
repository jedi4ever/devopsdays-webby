title: "The Deliverator: a dashboard to tell you why code is not live yet"
---

**Abstract:**

Software development goes through a series of stages, from code being
written & reviews, to building and deployment, testing both automated
and by QAs, until the final release.

Typically, each step is managed by a separate service. At the
Guardian, we manage stories in Pivotal Tracker. We commit code in Git
and push it to Github, where we use pull requests to review and sign
off code. TeamCity runs tests and builds deployable artifacts. Our
RiffRaff system deploys those artifacts to the different pre-prod
environments, where they can be QA'd before they are released to the
production environment.

While it is a good habit for services to do one thing and do it really
well, it also means that the state of a piece of code (generally, a
branch in Git) is scattered, and it becomes unusually hard to answer
some simple questions such as:

* Does a feature build successfully? Has it been code reviewed? Has it
been QA'd?
* What branch is deployed on each of the environments? Is it the latest build?
* What changes are about to be released?
* What changes have been released last?

Or more generally, why is code not live yet?

The Deliverator is a dashboard we use to provide immediate and
up-to-date information on all the code under development. Rather than
enforcing a fixed workflow, it displays the build and review states as
simple indicators, fetched from the different services involved. It
also shows what feature is deployed to each environment, and allows
updating or deploying a new feature anywhere in a single click.
