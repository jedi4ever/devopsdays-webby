title: "Who you gonna call? - getting devs on support"
---

**Abstract:**

In many traditional software shops developers don't go on the 24/7 rota.
However, the ideas behind DevOps are challenging this assumption. We'll
explain some of the thinking behind the move to having devs on call.
We'll talk about some of the patterns that worked for us and added
value. We'll also highlight some of the roadblocks and pitfalls
encountered in attempts to make this change. Hopefully you'll leave
inspired to try this yourself, equipped to transform support, from being
necessary evil, into a competitive advantage.

**Speakers:**

Tom Duckering and Jim Gumbley
