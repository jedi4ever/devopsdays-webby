title: "StartOps: Growing an ops team from 1 founder"
---

**Abstract:**

Description: Bootstrapped startups don't have the luxury of a full team of ops engineers available to respond to issues 24/7, so how can you survive on your own? This talk will tell the story of how to run your infrastructure as a single founder through to growing that into a team of on call engineers. It will include some interesting war stories as well as tips and suggestions for how to run ops at a startup.


**Speaker:**
