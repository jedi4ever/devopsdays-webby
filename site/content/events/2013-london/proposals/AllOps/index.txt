title: User experience vs. AllOps experience
---

**Abstract:**

How often have you come across software projects where analysts spend 100% of their time on end-user requirements? In my experience, this is the typical case in most software projects.

How often have you come across software projects where analysts spend their time on end-user requirements AND also on QA-team requirements, operations-team requirements, marketing-team requirements and other stakeholder requirements? In my experience, not that often.

In this talk I present most common patterns and anti-patterns from personal experience are useful for the DevOps crowd:

* Ops UX: application configuration file formats (XML, key=value, INI, etc)
* Ops UX: CLI vs. GUI
* Ops UX: monitoring application health
* Ops UX: ease of install, ease of upgrade
* QA UX: typical options that should be configurable so the system is testable in days instead of years
