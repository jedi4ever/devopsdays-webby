title: A journey to fit DevOps principles into a stable IT organisation
---

**Abstract:**

At Hiscox, We've been challenged by our business teams to “increase the pace of change”.  Early in 2013 we setup a project to work out the best way to do this.  We've used lean principles to look at all stages of the software lifecycle to see where we can get better, and while DevOps is a significant piece of the puzzle there are a number of other areas we need to improve.  We are part way through this journey and have just agreed what we are going to change, having already agreed the problem areas we need to fix.  The presentation hope to illustrate the journey we are on, what has gone well, what didn't go so well, and here's some things we'd do different.
