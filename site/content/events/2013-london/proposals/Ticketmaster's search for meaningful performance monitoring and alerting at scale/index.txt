title: Ticketmaster's search for meaningful performance monitoring and alerting at scale
---

**Abstract:**

A potted history of products we've used, why we changed them and the challenges we currently face which have lead to our investment of effort into Splunk, LogStash, Kibana, OpenTSDB and . . . . some open questions . . . . 

It's the story of how the Technical Operations group came to appreciate the need to share information and to encourage collaboration between groups and across organisations.

**Speaker:**

Connon is part of the Systems Engineering team in Global Technical Operations at Ticketmaster and has been with Ticketmaster since 1997. Ticketmaster is the worldwide leader in ticketing for sporting, music, theatre and arts events.
