title: "Beautiful Builds and Build Patterns"
---

**Abstract:**

In this talk Roy Osherove (Author of BeautifulBuilds.com book) will talk about common problems during an automated build process, and common patterns on solving those problems. This is still very much a work in progress, as such patterns have never been specifically articulated as such, yet I feel that this can be quite an important work that can be used and will stand the test of time. Some patterns and tricks: Shipping Skeleton, Rolling Waves of Confidence, Inversion Of Build Control,Visual Script, and more. more info at beautifulbuilds.com 

**Speaker:**

Roy Osherove is the author of "The Art of Unit Testing" and is currently writing his new book "Beautiful Builds".
