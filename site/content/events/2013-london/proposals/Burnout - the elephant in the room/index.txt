title: Burnout - the elephant in the room
---

**Abstract:**

Not that long ago, I was almost ready to jack in my job at a startup. I
wasn't particularly unhappy with the work, I was adequately paid and my
colleagues were pleasant enough, but I'd just had enough with the job.
All the months of long hours working for a startup were taking their
toll. I just felt completely uninterested in the work I was doing. I was
burnt out.

This is very common in the industry and we often just sweep it under the
carpet. It is something people don't like talking about or even
acknowledging - they often see it as a sign of weakness.

I believe that as we move to more agile methodologies, where we are
expected to produce more work in a shorter time, this will only become a
bigger issue.

In this talk, I will help you recognise some of the signs of burnout and
some solutions if you or your colleagues are on the path to burnout.
