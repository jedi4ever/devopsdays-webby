title: When you need a Devops Team
---

**Abstract:**

I've worked on projects in most industries both from India and the UK.  I have worked at many enterprises with the most blatant silos and obvious Dev and Ops problems.

I am fully bought-in to the definition of DevOps as rightfully created by the founders and evangelists.  However, I also recognise some benefits of having people dedicated to the success of Development and Operation team harmony (albeit often only for a temporary period).  I appreciate that creating another silo has obvious downsides, but I’ve read so much in strong opposition of creating a function responsible for DevOps concerns that I feel the appropriate usage of dedicated teams deserves some credit.  People shouldn’t be afraid / ashamed to try it and end up put off DevOps altogether.

In my talk I would strongly present both sides of the arguments backed up by real examples.  Then I will highlight the key points required to make the right judgement.
If you trust me with just 3 of your minutes I’ll spark up a useful discussion that I hope will help other people working with dinosaurs.
