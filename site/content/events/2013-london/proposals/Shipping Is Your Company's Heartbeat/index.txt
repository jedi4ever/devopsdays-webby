title: Shipping Is Your Company's Heartbeat
---

**Abstract:**

Software only becomes valuable when you ship it to customers. Before then it’s just a costly accumulation of hard work and assumptions.

Shipping unlocks a feedback loop that confirms or challenges those assumptions. It makes new things possible for your customers, and gives you the opportunity to focus on the next thing.

Shipping brings life to your team, to your product, and to your customers. Shipping is your company’s heartbeat.

**Speaker:**

Paul is an Operations Engineer with Intercom. He's the organiser for DevOps Ireland and a keen supporter of the DevOps movement, in it's various guises.
