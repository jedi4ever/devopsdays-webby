title: Dev, Ops and the future of operating systems 
---

**Abstract:**

Linux distros and Windows NT both date back to 1993 and the principles of the operating systems we use today are rooted in that era. The way we use O/S and software has changed dramatically since, and the role of O/S has shifted considerably. In contrast, O/S themselves still work with the same concepts and ideas, which gave birth to many tools trying to bridge the gap.
This talk will cover the evolution of O/S in recent years and emerging trends which may prevail in the near future.

**Speaker:**

Avishai Ish-Shalom

sysadmin/ops and opensource coder working for Fewbytes, an Israeli consulting company for operations and automation.
