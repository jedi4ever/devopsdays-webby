title: Threshold Voting Workshops
---

**Abstract:**

While maintaining our development infrastructure, we regularly have to
deal with a plethora of feature and plugin wishes. Because balancing all
these different wishes, requirements and purposes is so time-consuming,
we considered how to increase our efficiency in this area. We discovered
that threshold voting workshops help to quickly and consistently examine
which features, plugins or any other sort of thing a certain group
(developers, testers, end users) really need. This ignite talk is an
introduction to this method.
