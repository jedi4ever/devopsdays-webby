title: Why NoSQL Databases are the best for Devops?
---

**Abstract:**

Bringing Developers and Operations together helps companies to be more efficient to bring out new apps and services. Devops are using today many tools and technics to achieve continuous integration, deployment and monitoring. In this presentation will see why NoSQL databases are the best for Devops, and this for many reasons:

Schemaless/Flexible schemas allow developers to get back the control of whatâ€™s going in the application! (Old fashion DBA most of the time do not have enough knowledge of the application to drive the data model!)

Easy Scalability and always on are key! The new database engines are built to scale easily. You can change the topology of your cluster (adding node for example), manage failures and upgrade on a running system with no impact on the running application.

This presentation will use real life use cases to show that NoSQL engine ease the deployment and monitoring of new applications, and also talk about the key things to look when you chose a solution and deploy it.
