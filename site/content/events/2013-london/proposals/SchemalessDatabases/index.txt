title: "How schemaless databases fit into the continuous delivery world"
---

**Abstract:**

Covering the following ideas.

* Continuous delivery is good.
* Schema migrations are hard.
* Schemaless databases don't have this problem.
* Fact and Object storage should be a cross cutting concern like source control or configuration management
* How to make schemaless databases play nicely with the declarative tool world. (chef, puppet vs fabric)

My experience is drawn from 2 years in the devops infrastructure team at Maersk, and more recently 6 months at Basho helping customer integrate Riak into their platforms.
