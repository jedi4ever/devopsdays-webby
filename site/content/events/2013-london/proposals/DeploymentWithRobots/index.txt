title: "Automated deployments with robots"

**Abstract:**

Continuous deployment is the high art of devops. So there are several
ways to achieve this: many use a one-click deployment tool like
‘Deployinator’, or something self-written. This talk should give some
insights about how we at my old employer Digital Pioneers N.V. deploy
our apps controlled by an awesome chat robot named hubot (by github). It
will also show you how to simply do it the way we did it!

**Speaker:**

After my traineeship at InnoGames I continued working there as a lead
developer for a big social game. Next station was Digital Pioneers N.V.
there I’ve done a lot of high tech protoyping and DevOps working with
Symfony2, MongoDB, EC2, Scalarium, Redis, Node.js, CoffeeScript, statsd,
metrics and other cool tech stuff. After I left there I joined my
current company Jimdo, here I try to bring in my knowledge in software
quality and cloud computing.

I really love all the new technologies from NoSQL and node.js to Metrics
Driven Development and bringing cool tools and tech to my developer
colleagues. And I really really enjoy speaking at conferences, like I
did on phpunconf 2012 or TakeOff Conference 2013.
