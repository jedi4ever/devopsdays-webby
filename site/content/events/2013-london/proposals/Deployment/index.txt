title: "Deployment: More than just the click of a button"

**Abstract:**

Product teams being responsible for deployment is one of the most visible manifestations of the blurring of the development/operations boundary.  Making those who are changing software responsible for whether or not it's released to production can have a profound effect on the way they consider what constitutes done.

Moving the many existing Guardian applications, based on a wide mixture of technologies and running on a range of in-house and cloud infrastructure has been a long process, technically and socially.

This talk will cover 

* the cultural and technical changes we made to enable the transition, such as improving monitoring and making it visible to product teams
* the changing responsibilities between the various roles in the team
* the evolution of our approach to how deploys happen 
* why we made our own single-click deployment wheel; Riff Raff (https://github.com/guardian/deploy) and how it's been used and abused


**Speaker:**
