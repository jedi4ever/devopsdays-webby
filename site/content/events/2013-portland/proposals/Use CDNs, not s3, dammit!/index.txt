title: "Use CDNs, not s3, dammit!"
---

**Abstract:**

You are hosting your website or some static content on s3, so you're
good, right? NOPE. I'll show you why S3 is not a static web host, give
examples of CDNs, and show how it helps in real life, even for a small
website.

I've never done an Ignite talk. But I've attended them at Bagdad (and
online), and I've presented AWS/"cloud" knowledge informally many
times.

**Speaker:**

Ted Timmons
