**Abstract:**

Do you have to set up new EC2 instances using some saved notes? A
small bash script? You have to save an AMI? Level up and start using
OpsWorks ("chef for AWS"). I'll run through your best documentation
resources, how to find cookbooks, and how to make complicated recipes.

**Speaker:**

Ted Timmons
