title: Sensu Introduction
---

**Abstract:**

This talk is an introduction to Sensu, an open source monitoring framework
designed for the "cloud". I tell the story of how Sensu came to be,it's design
goals, and the philosophy behind it. I explain how Sensu works, how it's configured,
and provide practical usage examples. I share my experiences operating
Sensu at scale and demonstrate what it's like to work with Sensu and
Opscode's Chef.


**Speaker:**

Sean Porter is a toolsmith, with a love for composable systems. A
practitioner of passion driven development with an appetite for a good
post-mortem. Author of Sensu, a monitoring framework, and the
caretaker of its community. A tea connoisseur and admirer of fine
wine. Works at Heavy Water Operations, helping people automate and
monitor their infrastructure.

Note: This proposal has been submitted for DevOpsDays Vancouver,
however, I think it reasonable to give this talk in Portland as well.
