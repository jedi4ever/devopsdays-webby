title: Deploying all day without breaking the Internet
---

**Abstract:**

When operating at a certain scale, things can get hard. In addition to
dealing with a large volume of requests/data, downtime becomes less
and less acceptable.

Often as web companies get big, they face a pair of opposing
challenges 1. Not breaking the Internet - if a major service stops
working, people notice. Users can't do what they want to do and the
trust people place in the service provider can be lost. 2. Moving fast
- Product companies need to continually adapt to change and build new
tools to provide more value to their users.

This presents the eternal challenge of accomplishing both stability
and speed. In this talk we'll cover the processes, approaches, and
tools that one company uses to do over 20-30 deploys each day to over
400 servers without causing any major disruptions to service.

Some of the topics to be covered include:

  - Benefits of Service Oriented Architecture
  - Designing with ops in mind from day one
  - The power of NSQ (realtime distributed messaging)
  - Asynchronous > Synchronous (except when it isn't)
  - Designing for predictability
  - Route around failure (via hostpool)
  - Automate + Monitor ALL THE THINGS
  - Peer review for code + process
