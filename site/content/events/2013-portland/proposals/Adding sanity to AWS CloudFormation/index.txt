title: Adding sanity to AWS CloudFormation
---

**Abstract:**

SparkleFormation is a helper library that allows building and maintaining of AWS CloudFormation templates in Ruby. It provides novel features like: reusable components, simple merging strategies, and automatic support for future CloudFormation resources. It also can be used with Opscode's knife CLI tool to build CloudFormations from the command line. 

This talk will walk through the key features and demonstrate how the library works in action.

**Speaker:**
