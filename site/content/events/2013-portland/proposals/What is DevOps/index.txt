title: What is DevOps?
---

**Abstract:**

DevOps is a thing people talk about a lot today, but given any two people,
you'll probably get at least three explanations for what it means. This talk
endeavors to break down what DevOps *actually* means, and give a score card for
how we're doing.

DevOps is something you do, not something you are. Titles such as "DevOps"
engineer fundamentally misunderstand what this phenomenon is about.

What is DevOps? DevOps is applying engineering methodologies to operations.
Turning what used to be sys-admin problems, into engineering problems.

What are engineering methodologies anyways? Testability, introspectability,
and automation. How are we doing?

We're doing nicely on automation. Thus far this has really been at the heart of
the tools we look at.

But we're doing lousy at introspection and testing. Very few DevOps tools take
advantage of these paradigms of software development. I'll propose some ways in
which we can improve this.

Some material will be borrowed from a previous talk I gave, whose topic was
unrelated, but which overlaps on some of the "what are engineering
methodologies" material
(https://speakerdeck.com/alex/programming-and-programmers).
