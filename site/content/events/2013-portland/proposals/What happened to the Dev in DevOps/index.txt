title: What happened to the Dev in DevOps?
---

**Abstract:**

Great changes have been under way in our industry and or profession. With great
joy we have watched the advent of the DevOps movement and the formation and
growth of a community. Yet from my perch on the Dev side of the equation, I
can't help but feel inadequate. We've changed, sure, but we have not changed in
a way that is truly commensurate. We've gotten away from the original spirit of
"Dev+Ops cooperation." Operators have been laboring to grease code's path to
production, reducing the overhead and friction experienced by developers.
Meanwhile, many developers get to pass the buck, as organizations falsely
assume that Devops is a whole new "job" or "team" or just a new name for what
they used to call "Ops."  What can developers do to return the favor and reduce
the friction in the lives of operators? What tools and (dare I say it?)
processes can teams introduce to better shield operators from alert fatigue,
cognitive overload, sleep deprivation, and boredom? We'll take a look at how
environment consistency, ease of instrumentation, a little bit of discipline,
and a few other dev-side nuances can lead to ever more harmony between
developers and operators.
