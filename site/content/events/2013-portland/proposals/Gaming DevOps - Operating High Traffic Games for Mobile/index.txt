title: Gaming DevOps - Operating High Traffic Games for Mobile
---

**Abstract:**
GREE creates free-to-play mobile games for iOS and Android devices played by millions of people around the world.

This session will cover how we combined DevOps and ITIL practices into daily operations, including how monitor game health, deal with incident response, enable mass system configuration, and handle release management.

We will provide insights into the benefits and challenges of working with Amazon AWS and how game analytics are used to improve player engagement and drive monetization.

In addition, technical details will be shared around implementing EC2 auto-scaling policies combining on-demand and scheduled events, supporting major spikes in game traffic.

Eduardo Saito

I'm director of operations for a gaming company with offices in US, Canada, Japan and Korea, and we have multiple titles in the top grossing list in both iOS and Android app stores, including Modern War, Crime City, Kingdom Age, War of Nations and Jackpot Slots.

My team operates a farm of thousands of servers in both AWS and traditional datacenter, and support traffic generated by millions of players around the world.

We've implemented a DevOps team in the last 2 years, and I think we have interesting stories to share about the challenges we faced during this period, moving from a more traditional ITIL-based operations to a DevOps approach.
