title: "DevOps: The Best Thing Since Sliced Bread"
---

**Abstract:**

My team @ <it.megacorp>has been working to sneak in /evangelize agile,
continuous integration, and other goodness for years, and the one
truth we can be sure of, is that 99.999% of the time, managers and
executives will glaze over when a developer starts to talk about
agile, continuous integration, and other goodness.

DevOps is changing this: All of a sudden, we have a found a way to
tell suits about why they should care about agile, about debt, and
about CI. More than that, we're finding other teams that have been
trying to do bottoms-up culture change, and we're seeing the needle
move.

This talk includes references to a lot of the talks you've already
seen/ heard of (flicker '09! amazon '11! gene kim '12), since managers
like to know what other companies are doing. And it talks about how,
after years of failing to get suits the slightest bit interested in
agile & CI, we're getting some real traction.

This presentation is entirely about managing up, by someone who used
to be a web developer and now spends too much time in meetings and
writing powerpoint presentations.
