title: Replacing Process and Barriers with Feedback Loops and Trust
---

**Abstract:**

Traditional organizations operate in silo'd environments isolating
development from operations. Within that structure operations teams
create processes and intentional gates to limit the access and damage
to infrastructure by development teams. Processes and gates are
created as Ops often feel they have ownership, and a responsibility to
prevent damage to infrastructure.

While intended to prevent damage the gates and processes create
division amongst teams, which leads to further customer-impacting
errors. These structures are created with the best of intentions, but
are not the most effective technique.

Effective Devops organizations give developers full access to
infrastructure, and at the same time expect developers to own the
outcome of their coding and changes. Technologies such as advanced
monitoring / metrics systems, continuous integration testing, and
automated failure alerting give feedback post-change. These
technologies allow for a rapid deployment pace, which lessens the risk
of individual changes, and allows for easier troubleshooting in the
event of a failure. In addition, bringing development into the
production environment encourages dialog and trust between teams,
which leads to a better, easier to support product.
