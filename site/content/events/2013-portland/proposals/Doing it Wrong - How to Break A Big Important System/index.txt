title: "Doing It Wrong: How to Break A Big Important System"
---

**Abstract:**

SYNOPSIS
Automation enables us to make more changes at a faster pace than ever
before. This talk is a series of cautionary tales and lessons about
what happens when those changes go awry in production and how to avoid
making the same mistakes.

FORMAT
30 minute presentation, could be condensed into an Ignite talk with
less detail

DESCRIPTION
This talk will cover a range of real-world scenarios, the decisions
that led to them and their impact to a production service. Mostly,
these are war stories.

Launching a redesign of a high profile website and vastly
underestimating app performance. A very brief overview of the site's
architecture and how it unraveled in the days following the launch.

Upgrading Hadoop, even by a point release should not be taken lightly.
A story of how a junior admin destroyed six months of HDFS data by
forgetting to flip a single bit.

When running distributed database clusters on EC2, you're bound to
encounter some unusual behavior. In this case, we had servers randomly
reboot for two months straight and managed to reproduce the problem
using a brute-force method which led to confirmation of a kernel bug.

Sometimes managed hosting providers aren't as capable as you'd like.
Sometimes you ask them to reimage a server, and your entire internal
VLAN goes down. How we survived this outage... Three times.
