title: High Availability Server Clusters
---

**Abstract:**

This presentation describes the process by which services remain online even after a catastrophic failure. DRBD, Heartbeat and Pacemaker (all OSS) automatically fail the replicated mass storage arrays and server daemons to the cluster's standby server. I will present a best practice guide for the technologist building her own cluster. I will further provide practical (i.e. database) examples.

Production servers must stay online. Hardware and networking failures are among the primary causes of downtime.

Wouldn’t it be nice to have a system that reliably failed over to another server when Moore’s Law strikes? Wouldn’t it be nice if the standby server takes over without interruption of service to the users?

Since the Linux kernel 2.6.33, a system for replicating the server’s storage comes built-in. The Distributed, Replicated Block Device, or DRBD, replicates a system’s mass-storage “block for block.” DRBD, along with the OSS Heartbeat and Pacemaker, lets your server stack automatically failover to a standby should the primary server fail.

So, if you'd rather sleep at night rather than worrying about your local or cloud services staying online, this presentation is where it's at!
