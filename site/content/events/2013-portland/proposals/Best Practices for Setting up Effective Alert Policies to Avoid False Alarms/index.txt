  -Taming rollbar and other error-collection mechanisms
  -Group resources effectively
  -Avoid static thresholds in favor of dynamic, adaptive thresholds
  -Document alert response for others
  -Think twice about the importance of the alert at setup and documentation time 
  -Understand and prepare for anomalies caused of external events (examples from Netflix:  Oscars, Ski Week, Super Bowl, etc)
  -Maintain communication with your customers to understand bursts, etc.
