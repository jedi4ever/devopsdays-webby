title: Vagabond - Infrastructure testing and development tool
---

**Abstract:**

Infrastructure automation development can be time consuming,
especially when implementing solutions requiring integration and
testing between multiple nodes. Vagabond aims to accelerate this
process by decreasing the amount of time and interaction required to
build complex stacks in development.

Currently targeted at Opscode Chef[1], Vagabond is able to create an
entire isolated infrastructure stack which not only provides a
sandboxed development environment but also an integrated testing
environment. Building off the existing test-kitchen[2] testing suite,
Vagabond adds cluster style testing support for integration testing.
It also introduces serverspec[3] to provide more black box acceptance
style testing.

This talk will start with a brief history on the evolution of
Vagabond, covering the original problem set, the features that grew
from the initial solution, and the new features currently being
implemented. It will then move to a more in-depth look at setting up
and integrating Vagabond into an example development environment to
build multi-node stacks. Finally, some simple tests will be reviewed
and added to the example environment, concluding the presentation with
a ground up stack build and test run demonstration.
