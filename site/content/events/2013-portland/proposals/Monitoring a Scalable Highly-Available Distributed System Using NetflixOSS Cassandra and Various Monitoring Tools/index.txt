title: Monitoring a Scalable, Highly-Available Distributed System Using NetflixOSS, Cassandra and Various Monitoring Tools
---

**Abstract:**

In this talk, I present a cloud-native reference architecture called
FluxCapacitor (www.fluxcapacitor.com) that demonstrates most of the
key NetflixOSS components as well as Cassandra running on AWS.

FluxCapacitor emphasizes monitoring, metrics collection, and alerting.
I'll compare self-hosted solutions such as Graphite/Nagios to hosted
solutions such as Stackdriver.

**Speaker:**

Chris Fregly
