title: 'The Ghost Of DevOps Past: Creating a historical record of your infrastructure'
---

**Abstract:**
Are you keeping a log of your infrastructure as it changes? Developers
log the state of their application, but there is no equivalent for
DevOps.

As your cloud infrastructure becomes increasingly ephemeral, knowing
what the state of your infrastructure was three Tuesday's ago when you
had that one outage is nearly impossible. Add to that the fact that
ops teams have more people and the problem is compounded.

In this talk we'll discuss why it's important for you to keep track of
the state of your infrastructure and show examples of infrastructure
logs and how you can use them for capacity planning and postmortems.

**Speaker:**

Brad Heller
