title: Comparing the Popularity of Key Infrastructure Building Blocks
---

**Abstract:**

At Stackdriver, we've collected infrastructure-usage data from
hundreds of customers running on AWS.  

We'll share this aggregated data comparing the absolute and relative
popularity of following infrastructure building blocks:

  - Cassandra vs. MongoDB vs. DynamoDB vs. RDS vs. MySQL vs. Postgres
  - Nginx vs. Apache
  - Memcache vs. Redis vs. Elasticache
  - CollectD vs. StatsD
  - Windows vs. Linux
  - RabbitMQ vs. SQS
  - Solr vs. ElasticSearch vs. CloudSearch

We'll also break down the popularity data by AWS region which leads
to some interesting results.

How does your infrastructure compare?
