title: Visualization of Kanban Flow for DevOps
---

**Abstract:**

Ignite talk to quickly describe a common visualization problem DevOps
and a possible solution.

Visualization of the flow present in a kanban board is difficult,
without actually reading the details. The ignite talk will present an
idea that allows an "across the room grok" of what is going on. The
goal is that with the visualization at arms length, the viewer will be
able to understand the key information This ignite talk will describe
a visualization for a Kanban board that improves the ability to see
the level of active tasks that are working/waiting and undone/done.

This is important to DevOps members because kanban is becoming a
common way of managing flow.

The standard boards are useful up close, but a better visualization is needed.
