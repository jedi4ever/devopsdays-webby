title: NoOps Cassandra at Scale on AWS
---

**Abstract:**

At Stackdriver, we rely heavily on Cassandra running in AWS to store,
analyze, and query ~1.5 billion data points per day.

In this presentation, we highlight our reasons for choosing Cassandra
over other platforms as well as describe the novel architecture that
allows us to tolerate failures inherent to cloud environments.

We share tips, tricks, and best practices for running Cassandra on AWS
with Little-to-NoOps.

**Speaker:**

Chris Fregly
