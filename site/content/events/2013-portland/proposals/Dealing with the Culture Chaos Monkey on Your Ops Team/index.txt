title: Dealing with the Culture Chaos Monkey on Your Ops Team
---

**Abstract:**

It is hard to hire Operations people, almost impossible to get good
ones, and possibly harder than finding a good developer. Often you
have an Operations team that is siloed from the rest of the teams and
hide their work. The culture is hard to change. While implementing
some DevOps notions at the company I work for, I came across this
exact situation:

* The Developers were starting to collaborate more across teams.
* The Operations were putting out fires constantly - causing more work
for themselves
* Devs and Operations were not collaborating
* There was open hostility between the groups
* Operations was hiding their work from each other as well
* Incomplete solutions were being implemented (killing processes for
months instead of solving the root causes)

So we had to roll up our sleeves and get everyone working together.
Since the Operations team was stressed and overworked, we reduced
their workload to the important tasks of finishing the server
automation project. We asked developers to do the work they were
asking Operations to preform themselves, while Operations gave them
the tools, access and knowledge they needed to proceed. We also asked
some developers to join the Operations team in helping to automate the
server configs.

In the end, we saw more collaboration, less stress and projects
started to flow again. People were collaborating across the teams and
since there was now more eyes on the problems, they were getting
solved at a faster pace and with more complete solutions.

Why/Who Cares: This talk will be interesting to those who find
themselves embroiled in a Culture war at their jobs and will give
ideas and hints on how to solve the problems in front of them. As
well, it will show that even the worst environment can be improved
through collaboration.
