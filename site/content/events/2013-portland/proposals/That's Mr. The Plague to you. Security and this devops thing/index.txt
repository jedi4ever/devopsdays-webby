title: "That's Mr. The Plague to you! Security and this devops thing."
---

**Abstract:**

The landscape of security is very different to when we were
younger. What possible directions is it heading in, and have we been
looking at it wrong all this time?

Devops culture has brought a number of improvements to the way engineering
and operations interact with each other and it's time security comes along
for the party too! This talk will discuss what we, at Etsy, have done to
make people stop thinking of security as a four-letter word

Rationale:

It's a two part talk, at a dazzling pace, security talk and a devops talk.

I think this would be grand, as security is occasionally an after thought.
A lot of smaller shops don't have a dedicated security person or team, and
this talk features things you do even without that. Plus devops really
needs to stop being an organisational silo.... (=
