title: Gamification of Infrastructure
---

**Abstract:**

Gamification is rad and all, but how can it actually make my day job
as a SysAdmin better without making it worse first?  This talk will
explore ways to implement types of gamification in everyday use,
ranging from software to employee infrastructure.  



I'll cover the following:

- The two main types of gamification, and the strengths/weaknesses of
  them when applied to working in a tech company

    - Competitive (rewards/recognition)
    - Experiential (self expression, closure)


- Gamification within infrastructure on three levels:

    - Within the tools we **use**
        - Gamification plugins for tools we already use (jira, zendesk,microsoft word) 
        - personal use v. office wide
        - Ways to gamify tools without plugins (hip chat, etc)
    - Within the tools we **make**
        - what to consider when making a tool (example: employee directory)
        - How to do this without derailing from your project
    - Within the **people** we interact with
        - Alternative Reality Gaming in the workplace 
        - The incentives of gaming vs. the incentives of working
