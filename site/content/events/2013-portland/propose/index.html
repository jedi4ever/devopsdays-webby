<center><b>Call for proposals is now closed</b></center>
<hr>
There are three ways to propose a session:
<ol>
  <li><strong><em>A proposal for a talk/panel</em></strong> during the conference part : these are 30 minutes slots that will have all people's full attention as everybody will be in the one room.</li>
  <li><strong><em>An Ignite talk</em></strong> that will be presented during the<a href="/pages/ignite-talks-format"> Ignite sessions</a>: these are 5 minutes slots with slides changing every 15 seconds (20 slides total) also presented to all attendees in one room.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Openspace session</em></strong>: even without a prepared presentation we welcome the discussion and interaction by having people propose a session on the fly during the openspace opening. Check the <a href="/pages/open-space-format">openspace format</a> for more information.
</ol>

### Even if you don't propose, please consider [commenting on proposals submitted by others](../proposals/)

Our main criteria to make it to the top selection are:

- _original content_: content not yet presented at other conferences, or a new angle to an existing problem
- _new presenters_: people who are new to the space and have insightful stuff to tell, we want to hear everbody's voice. <strong>If you've presented a 30-minute talks at any Devopsdays in the last 2 years, we encourage you to submit an ignite talk or conduct an openspace session. In addition, please consider encourage other speakers to submit proposals!</strong>
- _no vendor pitches_: as much as we value vendors and sponsors, we just don't think this is the right forum. There is a demo openspace slot where you have 5 minutes to show products.


<strong>Some suggestions to get you thinking:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Reports from the frontlines: what worked (and didn't) while implementing Devops in your organization?</li>
	<li>Devops at scale / in the Enterprise</li>
	<li>Applying Devops principles beyond the tech organization (e.g., HR, Finance, etc.)</li>
	<li>Devops, Lean, Agile: what's shared and what's unique?</li>
	<li>And of course any other topic in the realm of Devops</li>
</ul>

<strong>How to make a proposal:</strong> Send an email to [<a href="mailto:proposals-portland-2013@devopsdays.org">proposals-portland-2013@devopsdays.org</a>] with the following information:
<ol>
	<li>Proposal working title (can be changed later)</li>
	<li>Type (presentation, panel discussion, moderated general discussion, debate, etc.,ignite)</li>
	<li>Description or abstract</li>
</ol>

<strong>Rules:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Be specific... we aren't mind readers (a description of about 20 lines is about right)</li>
	<li>Detail is good... but not as important as explaining why your proposal would be interesting</li>
	<li><strong>Nominations welcome</strong>... if you know someone who has content/experience relevant to the DevOps conversation, please point us in their direction!</li>
	<li>No tool talks if tools are not open-source or generally commerically available</li>
	<li>Multiple proposals welcome... just follow the other rules</li>
</ul>
