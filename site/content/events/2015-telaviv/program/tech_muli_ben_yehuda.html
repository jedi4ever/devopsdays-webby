## Developing the Stratoscale System At Scale

Stratoscale is building a distributed operating system for clouds that manages the compute, storage, and network resources of thousands of machines connected over myriad networks and spanning multiple data centers. The company has grown in two years from two founders to an army of scores of developers, all constantly developing new code and pushing the system to its limits.

This talk will focus not on the Stratoscale system but rather on how the development team develops, tests, deploys and operates it. How do we get tens of developers to work productively at a high velocity while maintaining system cohesion and quality? How can we tame the inherent complexity of such a distributed system? How do we continuously integrate, test, deploy and operate it? How do we take devops to the limit? And just how tasty is our own dog food?

We will share the lessons we've learned, what worked for us and what didn't, and our thoughts on tackling the next challenge: an order of magnitude increase in the number of developers/operators.
