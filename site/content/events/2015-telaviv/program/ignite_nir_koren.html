## Security Tests as part of Continuous Integration process

Continuous Integration (CI) is a key agile software engineering practice where members of a team, or teams in a project, integrate their work frequently.
In order to achieve Usable Software each Sprint a CI process has to be clearly defined and implemented.
The problem today is the lake of frequency of scanning static code (using tools like HP Fortify, Checkmarx) and dynamic scan (using tools like IBM AppSCan, HP WebInspect).
Therefore It's not connected to CI processes often. The reasons are:
 
1.  Complicity - requires someone who has experience and time.
2.  Time - The scan takes long and requires extra attention.
3.  Stability of those processes.
 
This leads to the following symptoms:

1. Security issues are being discovered once in a release or more.
2. The developers need to reproduce the issues that created too long ago.
3. Security issues are being part of the code.
4. Difficulty to fix issues since sometime additional post developments are based on this code
5. Unable to track of trends.

 
How did we implemented it?
 
* Build of latest code.
* Deploy to a reference system
* Scan the Java code statically (HP Fortify)
* Scan the JS code statically (CheckMarx)
* Scan the deployed system dynamically (HP WebInspect)
* Analysis and report generation of API to the CI notifications.
* HTML mail report sends to the relevant people.
