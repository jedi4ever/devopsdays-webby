## Tools, Culture, and Aesthetics: The Art of DevOps
As we pass the six year anniversary of the naming of that Thingâ„¢ we now know as DevOps, a curious puzzle remains in the forefront of practitioners: organizations from 10-person startups to multinational enterprises continue to wrestle with what DevOps means, what it looks like, what behaviors it entrails, and fundamentally, how to _consistently_ successfully implement it.

For every case study of the storied "unicorn companies," there exist numerous counterexamples of teams in the trenches, struggling to fit the elusive pieces of "tools and culture" together in a coherent way.

In this talk, we'll examine why these now school-aged ideals remain so difficult to implement, explore why DevOps is often described as "the movement that refuses to identify itself," and what your team can do to confront the dichotomies they are likely to face as they transform how they, their teammates, and their company go about their daily work.
