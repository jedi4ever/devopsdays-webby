## Terrible Ideas in Git 

Adapted from his class "The Screaming Horrors of Git," Corey takes us on a magical tour through the (mis)use of Git to do things its creators never intended. 
In this humorously delivered exploration of one of the open source community's more ubiquitous tools, Corey demonstrates that a finely crafted wrench makes a barely acceptable hammer if you hold it wrong.


## About the speaker - [Corey Quinn](https://twitter.com/quinnypig)

Corey has a long and storied history as a consultant -- long, in that every year he did it felt like three years, and storied, in that he's got a few. Prior to his current role as Director of DevOps at FutureAdvisor, he spent the past two years at Taos, where he served as a systems architect, ad-hoc recruiter, advocate for driving transformational change throughout organizations, and (due to a misunderstanding around what a "standup meeting" really was) an improvisational comic. One of the early developers behind Saltstack, Corey also has a rich history of contributing to various open source projects.

Corey's hobbies include motorcycles, wearing suits, and drinking whiskey-- it's a shame that they all don't work well together. He lives in San Francisco with his wife and two rodents of unusual size masquerading as dogs.
