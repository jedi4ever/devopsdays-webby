## Java in binary - smaller and faster

Ever wondered why you need so much memory, CPU and network bandwidth to process and analyse your data in Java? 
Big data frameworks like Hadoop only make matters worse, Spark goes some way to easing the issue but underlying all this is the problem that each Java object is, on average, larger than XML.

Ridiculous memory usage, appalling serialisation and machine-stopping GC pauses leave us struggling to keep up. 
John will explain and demonstrate some very simple changes, based on C/C++ that will give up to 2 orders of magnitude better performance on a fraction of the hardware.
