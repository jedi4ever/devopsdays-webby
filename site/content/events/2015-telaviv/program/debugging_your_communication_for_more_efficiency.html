## Debugging your communication for more efficiency
Whenever people come together, communications starts at once! You can´t stop it! Due to our modern times, additional to the original face-to-face communication we use a lot of different communication channels like phones, chats, live webinars and emails.

As communication is a very complex topic misunderstandings are part of daily our work. We have to spend a lot of time to deal with these misunderstandings or - what is worse - things will go wrong.

The more different characters work together in cross-functional teams like DevOps the higher the probability of misunderstandings. With release cycles getting shorter and shorter or continuous delivery, time is a very precious factor in IT projects. So why do we waste time in clearing up misunderstandings? For more efficiency it will be extremely helpful to identify the bugs in your communication and eliminate them to reduce misunderstandings and save time!

In this session theoretical background will be combined with best practice; the importance of further education in communication skills especially for “people from IT” to reach more efficiency will be pointed out.
