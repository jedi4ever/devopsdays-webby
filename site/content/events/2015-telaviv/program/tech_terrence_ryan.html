## Containing Chaos with Kubernetes 

This session will begin with a level set. If people don't know Docker, I'll catch them up. If they know Docker, I'll move on to making connected Docker container work together to begin with. Then I'll show how to do the same with Kubernetes. I'll then show off the Replication Controller which is the special sauce of Kubernetes which makes sure that if you say you need 5 containers running the web image, and one goes down another one will spin up.  All of that should take a good 45 minutes to show with Q/A
