## CFP is now CLOSED

## There are four types of session:

1. **_A proposal for a talk/panel_** during the conference part: these are 45 minutes slots that will have all people's full attention as everybody will be in that one room.
2. **_An Ignite talk_** that will be presented during the<a href="/pages/ignite-talks-format"> Ignite sessions</a>: these are 5 minutes slots with slides changing every 15 seconds (20 slides total) also presented to all attendees in one room
3. **_Workshops_**: A hands-on session, typiclly few hours long, focusing on specific technologies and different levels of expertise (beginner/intermediate/expert)
4. **_Openspace session_**: even without a prepared presentation we welcome the discussion and interaction by having people propose a session on the fly during the openspace opening. Check the <a href="/pages/open-space-format">openspace format</a> for more information


## Our main criteria to make it to the top selection are:

* _original content_: content not yet presented at other conferences, or a new angle to an existing problem
* _new presenters_: people who are new to the space and have insightful stuff to tell, we want to hear everbody's voice
* _no vendor pitches_: as much as we value vendors and sponsors, we just don't think this is the right forum. There is a demo openspace slot where you have 5 minutes to show products.

## Some suggestions to get you thinking:

* What is the role of QA/Tester in devops, how do we integrate QA in the continuous delivery process
* The impact devops has on traditional security/auditing/change control
* How does devops co-exist with ITIL, Cobit
* How about release management ?
* What about configuration management and delivery in Mixed Unix AND Windows environments
* Building dashboards because #monitoringsucks
* The impact of devops on HR policies, and the hiring process
* Help prove that devops can scale beyond the 5-8 person web startups, we love traditional IT enterprise cases
* With all the automation, data is still a hard thing to handle, how does it affect, DBA's, backup strategies, ...
* How to involve the business in devops
* How to get YOUR boss involved, how do you make the business case
* And of course any other topic in the realm of Devops
* Beyond Configuration Management, about challenges like orchestration, or doing things at large scale

## Rules:
* Be specific... we aren't mind readers (a description of about 20 lines is about right)
* Detail is good... but not as important as explaining why your proposal would be interesting
* Nominations welcome... if you know someone who has content/experience relevant to the DevOps  conversation, please point us in their direction!
* Multiple proposals welcome... just follow the other rules
