title: "Being an Agent of Change - a One-Year Retrospective"
---

**Abstract:**

Take one DevOps Enthusiast, add him to an established company to help drive culture shift, and see what happens in a year.

Originally hired as "Sr. Ops. Engineer" to a break-out team, but the executives intend "a larger role" in shifting the culture and driving adoption of a DevOps mindset and building a Continuous Delivery Pipeline. Oh, and help migrate from Java-on-Windows to Linux.

This will be a story (as yet incomplete), and will include some points of what has worked, missteps, (probably) cursing, and a lot of love for a lot of new friends.
