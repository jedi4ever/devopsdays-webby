title: "Infrastructure deployment contracts and zero downtime deployment with Orcé
---

**Abstract:**

New Applications at the TIM Group must implement the deployment infrastructure contract and pass the test. Those that do get zero-downtime continuous deployment for "free". TIM Group presents "Orc": a tool for providing zero-downtime deployments of contract compliant web applications. Orc works by executing a safe sequence of steps to deploy web applications without taking the service down. It reads the desired state of the world from a CMDB and continually issues instructions to the environment. It uses MCollective for discovery and command execution of the hosts.
