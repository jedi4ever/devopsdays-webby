title: Bootstrapping a meetup
---

**Abstract:**

From the experiences of start the Infrastructure Coders meetup, I will go into details around how to start a meetup from scratch:

- Validating the idea: How to ensure that the meetup group is feasible for the area and target community/audience.
- Promoting the meetup: How to get the word out there.
- Keeping costs down: Starting a meetup the costs are borne by the organisers. Tips on how to reduce these, while not creating a financial barrier to your target community.
- Building  the community: How to keep your community growing, getting great discussions and keeping it "fresh".
- Observations on other failed meetups: What doesn't seem to work.

No prerequisite knowledge required for this talk.

Attendees should walk away from the talk with an increased confidence and that creating a community in the area is not as difficult as assumed.

**Speaker:**

Matthew Jones.
