title: "Podularity FTW!"
---

**Abstract:**

In "The Connected Company" (O'Reilly, 2012), Dave Gray describes how
pods -- "small, autonomous units" -- are the basic building blocks of
a flexible, scalable and resilient organisation. At Wooga, we have
used pods (though we call them "game teams") as the main
organizational unit from the beginning, and this has led quite
naturally to a strong devops culture.

In this talk, I will tell how this decision came about, how it has
played out, which practical benefits the approach provides -- but
also, what problems we have run into. As a bonus, I will report on a
recent attempt to use podularity as the technical system architecture,
where scalability and resilience are major concerns as well.
