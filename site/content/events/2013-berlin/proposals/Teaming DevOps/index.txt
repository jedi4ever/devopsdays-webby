title: "Teaming DevOps"

**Abstract:**

There is an old thesis saying that the same amount of time is needed for
the last 10% of an IT project as for the first 90%. One of the reasons
for this is that most of a project’s integration aspects are commonly
postponed to the end. Even in today’s agile projects there is seldom an
infrastructure specialist as a fixed team member.

Only if you combine the infrastructure, quality assurance and
development skills in a team you will be able to address those
integration aspects from the very beginning.  And if you do this you
will get the real DevOps: The Team!
