title: "Applied Devops"
---

**Abstract:**

From small businesses, to public-listed companies and not-for-profits,
I am being asked the same questions: What can we do to apply devops
and what does that look like for our organisations?

Drawing on experience from various organisations, I will talk about
patterns that help (or hinder) businesses in applying devops practices
from a "on the ground" point of view.

Using various techniques from within teams, I'll go through examples
that will help break down the barriers, improve communication and
reach that "nirvana".

Finally, talk about the challenges that organisations face once they
have reached that "nirvana" and what is next for the organisations and
the community.
