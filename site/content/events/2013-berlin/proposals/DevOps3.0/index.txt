title: "DevOps 3.0 - Where we are now and what we found out on the way"
---

**Abstract:**

Immobilienscout is a midsized organisation with ~150 Devs and ~40 Ops.
The focus of the talk is not from a managers point of view but instead a
snapshot from a Dev- and an Ops-guy, who switched roles for a few months.

It seems that the DevOps culture is quite sucessful and well established
at Immobilienscout. We would like to talk about what we learned and the
insights we had. We want to share how we are doing DevOps and what cool
stuff is happening in order to be an inspiration for you and to guide
what to aim for at your company.

Looking back we want to reflect on the already existing culture and
preconditions that were necessary for DevOps to happen.

When doing DevOps or Agile one of the most important parts is empowering
the team. Which in return will bring many not so obvious consequences
and greatly change the way the team works and the relationship between
management and team. We also want to share some of our learnings on that
topic.

This talk will be about
<ul>
<li> the current state of the DevOps culture at Immobilienscout
<li> the important preconditions that made it possible for DevOps to happen
<li> the not so obvious issues that will pop up if you do DevOps and beyond
</ul>

**Speaker:**
Marcel Wolf, Felix Sperling
