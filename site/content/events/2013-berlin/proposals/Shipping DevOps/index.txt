**Abstract:**

Driven by the need to move quickly CoreMedia's customers are demanding
deployment automation and continuous delivery. Consequently, as a
vendor of an enterprise content management system, CoreMedia is
incorporating support for deployment tools and processes directly into
its product.

The presentation covers the challenges that CoreMedia has been facing
and the solutions the engineers have applied when advancing the
product to integrate with automation tools and processes. The
challenges included that the development teams had only limited
operations experience and could only acquire knowledge from CoreMedia
professional services and customers in slow feedback cycles. The
product is deployed on various platforms, each requiring their
toolchains, thus generating complex requirements.

To overcome the obstacles, a dedicated development team has been
ramped-up to concentrate on deployment automation and continuous
delivery. They created automated setups for CoreMedia QA and CI
systems to gain operations experience and establish a fast in-house
feedback cycle.
