title: "Why should I know about ITIL ??"
---

**Abstract:**

You are a die hard coder and loves playing with functions and
experimenting with new technology. You have a great application,
software or service but fails to deliver it to your clients, partners
or to best utilize service of your vendor. Then the problem lies in
process and not product.

This is same as someone speaking Urdu in USA and trying to sell bread
in Apple electronic store.  ITIL provides the foundation for quality
IT Service Management through documented, proven processes that cover
the entire Service Lifecycle. It is easy for organizations to learn,
tailor and implement to suit their environment.

**Speaker:**

Raj Dudi, works as Software Engineer with ERST Gmbh Hamburg. He has 6
years of expereince and spent most of his experience working with the
ITIL process.

Before moving to Germany in Oct 2011, he has worked in
India and in US. He has an ITILv3 certification.
