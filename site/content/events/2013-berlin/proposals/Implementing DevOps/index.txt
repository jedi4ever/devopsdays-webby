title: "Implementing DevOps… and Making it Actually Stick"
---

**Abstract:**

If you’ve ever been involved in promoting cultural changes within an
organization, you may have experienced something even more
disheartening than flat-out rejection: a full rollback of cultural
change and a decade-long resentment of anyone remotely associated with
the implementation. This has happened at countless organizations with
agile, with SOA, with virtualization – and it’s starting to happen
with DevOps.

How can such as simple idea that’s been so successful at so many
companies become such a resounding failure at others? It’s not the
organization, and it’s certainly not DevOps. The problem lies in the
implementation, and ultimately, with its promoters and champions.

In this talk, I’ll discuss both technical and organizational
strategies for a successful long-term DevOps implementation, go over a
few big failures at big companies, and cover the common and
not-so-common pitfalls when promoting this type of cultural change.

**Speaker:**
