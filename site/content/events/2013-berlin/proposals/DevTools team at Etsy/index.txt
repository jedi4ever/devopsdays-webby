title: "DevTools team at Etsy"
---

**Abstract:**

The Etsy DevTools team was created to foster collaboration between
engineering and operations and also between different teams within
engineering. We provide the tools to make it easy for everyone to
deploy, reaching from deployment tools to developer VMs and CI
infrastructure automation. Our main concern is to make processes fast
and simple to enable developers to do their work with maximum
happiness.

The talk will be about what are the main concerns of the DevTools team
and its place between Engineering and Operations. I will give examples
of how processes were improved and how we introduced tools which make
it simple and safe to give developers access to production servers and
data without causing ops headaches.

**Speaker:**

Daniel Schauenberg is a software engineer at Etsy's DevTools team. He
spends his days automating infrastructure with Chef, making sure
everybody can deploy and removing friction in processes where
possible.
