title: "Administer the devops pill across the enterprise"
---

**Abstract:**

Devops addresses the last mile of continuous delivery. It advocates
the tearing down of silos between development and operations. It kind
of assumes that silos don't exist elsewhere. This is often not true in
enterprise IT where the number of silos correlates well with the
number of vice presidents. This anti-pattern of org design takes two
forms. One is when you have a VP sw-dev, VP Data, VP configuration
management, VP Testing, VP UX, VP Deployment. The other is when you
have a product manager along with a VP Sales, VP Marketing, VP Support
and VP Training. On the other hand, an org design based on true
cross-functional teams has teams accountable for business outcomes and
puts one person in clear charge of each team. This part of getting
things right can be classifed as CD for execs and basically involves
applying the devops pattern to general org design. There is also a
part two.

Tooling can also hinder cross functional behaviour. Especially when
access to tools are granted on a strict need-to-use basis. So for
example, only sales guys get salesforce access. Or when marketing
disallows self-service publishing from the product teams. Or when the
devs use one tool for continuous integration and the deployment teams
uses a completely different disconnected tool for release
automation. Sometimes commercial considerations (licensing costs)
encourage this behaviour but it doesn't serve the cause of tearing
down silos. So we need a new kind of culture that restricts access to
tools only where unavoidable but is open otherwise.
