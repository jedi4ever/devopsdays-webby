Continuous delivery is not an option anymore for organizations and
companies that implement online services and products. The ability to
rollout new code changes quickly and as frequently as needed is an
important business enabler. In this session we’ll review the current
options for CD in the cloud, and learn how to implement an automated
CD process using Cloudify and Jenkins.
