title: "Two Point Oh My! Release engineering for everyone."
---

**Abstract:**

With continuous integration, continuous deployment and packaging
systems that just install all the latest shiny for us, we don't need
to worry about releases any more..do we?

Release engineering is an important aspect of any projects development
t and deployment cycle. From testing to building, packaging and
releasing, a version number is not just an arbitrary string and
relying on one person to understand how your product makes it to
customers is a recipe for disaster.

Walk to this way and we'll explore methodologies and tooling for
managing releases and solutions to common problems such as:
<ul>
<li>Dependency tracking and avoiding stale dependencies without breaking builds.</li>
<li>Documenting builds and release processes for both devs and ops.</li>
<li>Understanding when to automate..and when not.</li>
</ul>
