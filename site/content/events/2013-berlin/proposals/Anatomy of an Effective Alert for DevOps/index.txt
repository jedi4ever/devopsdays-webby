title: "Anatomy of an Effective Alert for DevOps"
---

**Abstract:**

One of the outcomes of embracing the DevOps philosophy, has been
developers participating on-call rotations and receiving alert
notifications. Having the developers who have developed the code and
have through understanding of the inner-workings of the applications
have been invaluable in resolving potential problems before any impact
on users, however sending alerts that are high in quantity but low in
quality to the developers can have a very detrimental impact on the
developer productivity and cause alert fatigue.

Ensuring developers that are participating in operational processes do
not get bogged down with alerts demand high quality alerts . This talk
will make the case for the need to design alerts and layout some of
the practices that can be employed by ops organizations to improve
quality of alerts created by the monitoring systems.
