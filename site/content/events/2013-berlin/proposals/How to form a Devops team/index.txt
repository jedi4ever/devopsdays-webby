title: "How to form a DevOps team?"
---

**Abstract:**

Did you ever worked within an operations team that was overwhelmed
by firefighting? And late deployments and no time for
improvements?  Well, there is good news for you. You are not the
only one. And it can be changed to the better.

Based on my experience at Nokia I show what might help; how an
emerging DevOps approach succeeded to overcome a situation like
this.

We will take a look on the 2-year journey of my DevOps team, and
how it improved the delivery frequency and platform availability
significantly. For us "Baby Step" improvements played a very
crucial role.

We will see how the team changed over time, and take a look at its
forming-storming-norming-performing cycle.  Furthermore the
interactions, tensions with the other teams are worth a glimpse,
as well as the (positive) impact of the DevOps team on the
organization around.

This talk will also cover how the interpretation of roles,
responsibilities and job profiles changed notably over time

**Speaker:**
