title: "Node.js meets Chef and Gradle. Three worlds coming together"
---

**Abstract:**

Traditionally, Node.js, Chef and Gradle communities used to hang out
separately, each one using their own tool. But as we know, it's only a
combination of useful tools that brings the maximal benefits to the
DevOps. This presentation joins the forces of these technologies and
demonstrates a fully automated deployment of Node.js application on
Amazon EC2 with Chef and Gradle. We'll see the steps involved, how
each technology contributes to the process and finally consider if it
could really work otherwise.

**Speaker:**
