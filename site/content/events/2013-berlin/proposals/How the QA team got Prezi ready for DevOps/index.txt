title: "How the QA team got Prezi ready for DevOps"
---

**Abstract:**

Prezi would not be where it is today if it wasn't for DevOps and
continuous delivery. And for that, we can thank the QA department,
since without tests we can depend on, the operations guys would be
nervous having 20+ deploys to production per day by people who don't
understand every part of Prezi's infrastructure. The classical DevOps
balance between developers (who are measured by their speed) and
operations (whose goal is maximizing availability) needs a third
entity, QA, to make sure the user-perceived quality of the product is
acceptable.

In the beginning, the Prezi codebase was poorly tested, as the primary
goal was getting something working out the door as soon as
possible. As the volume of untested code began to grow, product
quality deteriorated. In response, the first QA hire, and eventually
the establishment of a dedicated QA team came to pass. This team made
a major contribution to how Prezi works in three ways:

<ul>
<li>QA established quality as a value within the organization, now taken seriously by every employee.
<li>QA made it easy for developers to write tests by creating the necessary tools and documentation.
<li>QA made us realize that if a bad commit got deployed, we should blame our lack of tests, not the author of the faulty code.
</ul>

Similar to QA, the DevOps culture at Prezi has also matured
considerably. Today, there is no longer a QA or a dedicated DevOps
team, as each of the product development teams have assumed
responsibility for the quality and operations aspects of their output.

The topic of my talk is the journey from the beginnings of Prezi to
where we are today from the vantage points of QA and DevOps. Emphasis
will be placed on the organizational, people-centric problems and
solutions, but I will also share the technical aspects of how we work.
