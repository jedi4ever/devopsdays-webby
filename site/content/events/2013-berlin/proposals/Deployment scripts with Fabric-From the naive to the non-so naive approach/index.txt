title: "Deployment scripts with Fabric. From the naive to the non-so naive approach"
---

**Abstract:**

This talk is about good practices on the deployment process,
basically. I will expose how the deployments evolve all over the time
from a small startup scenario to a medium company and from a small
single script to a infrastructure as code paradigm.

I will use concrete examples for a django, wsgi, nginx, mysql typical setup.

In my opinion, the talk is interesting for everyone that is building a
product and obviously has to release it at some point. It is really
technical and based on a python technology stack but the patterns can
be applied on other environments.

**Speaker:**

Jose A. Martin, is a devops and backend engineer working for a startup
here in Berlin. The talk is based on his personal experience in the
last 2 years.
