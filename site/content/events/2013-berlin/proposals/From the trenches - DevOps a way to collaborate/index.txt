title: "From the trenches - DevOps a way to collaborate"
---

**Abstract:**

My talk will be about how we at Avanza Bank, an E-trader in Sweden
working with continuous delivery and ship new software to production
every second Friday and try do it even more frequently. How we formed
a delivery team with developer, architect, tester and operation. How
that team are responsible for the processes and tools used by the dev
and ops guys. How each team member at operation collaborate with one
or two Dev teams regarding all ops needs for those team, such as new
infrastructure, monitoring, log mgmt and so on. The essence of my talk
will be that DevOps is all about collaboration, communication and
culture not a new technology or job description.

**Speaker:**

Matti Klasson works at Avanza Bank, a Swedish E-trader company. Tens
of thousands share transactions and investment fund commission notes
are handled each day.
