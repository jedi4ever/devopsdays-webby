title: "DevOps@Runtime"

**Abstract:**

The term devops not only describes a new development philosophy or
company culture, in the production system it all comes down to people,
devs and ops, who develop and maintain the platform.

The talk is about the people and how those people with their different
mindsets, interests and skills can be brought to work together and be
one team. The talk is based on my real life experience with high
traffic platforms in germany in last 10 years (friendscout, parship,
c-date etc) This is not a MoSKito talk, but MoSKito will make an
occurence ;-)

**Speaker:**

Leon Rosenberg
