title: "Node.js meets Jenkins, Gradle and Chef!"

**Abstract:**

Have you ever had to automate a Node.js application deployment? One
way of doing so would be to use Node.js hosting providers, but what if
you decide to host your applications in-house? As it turns out,
automating a Node.js operation is not as easy as it sounds (you can
trust me on that) and here at Trademob, we tried several approaches
before settling on a combination of tools. This presentation is
targeted at Node.js developers and Dev Ops engineers. I'm going to
show what we tried, what worked and what did not work. I'll then
present a setup based on Jenkins, Gradle and Chef that we now
successfully use for testing, deployment and monitoring of Node.js
applications. You'll learn from our mistakes and see how we made it
all work in the end. Most importantly, you'll be able to do the same
as us - since all tools and plugins required are free and
open-sourced.

Come to this session and make your Node.js automation a breeze!
