title: "What's really to blame? - A day in the life of your PHP app"

---

**Abstract:**

You know how to play the Blame Game when Production is broken?
Probably you have good reasons for that. Nevertheless, it's better to
work out what really went wrong - fast. See in this session how a new
PHP application can be deployed flawlessly, scaling up and down and
can be managed automatically. Discover how Dev & Ops can work
together, in concert, if the worst nightmare happens and the
application breaks.

**Speaker:**

Jan Burkl
