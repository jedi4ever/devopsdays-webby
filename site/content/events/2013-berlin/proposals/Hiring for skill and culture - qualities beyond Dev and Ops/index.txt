title: "Hiring for skill and culture - qualities beyond Dev and Ops"
---

**Abstract:**

As you probably know, looking for a Dev with Ops experience
or an Ops person with a GitHub repo is not enough. There are
two main criteria when hiring someone for a DevOps organisation:
social/technical skills and the consequences for the organisations
culture.

I will outline things to look for in hires and share some stories
from a large organisation moving towards DevOps.
