title: "Operations as a Service - handling traditional enterprise projects"
---

**Abstract:**

The "cloud" has opened the traditional "big enterprise" environments
for outsourcing parts of their IT that has been kept in-house for a
long time. Large companies and public institutions are looking for
ways to save money, receive higher quality services, and become more
flexible.

At gocept we provide an "operations as a service" hosting environment
that picks up infrastructure development and application operations
tasks for traditional enterprise-style projects: intranet, extranet
and integration applications, corporate web sites, and such.

Over the last years we have served large enterprise and public
institutions by applying and researching DevOps-style processes, FLOSS
technology, and computer science to achieve those goals.

Our personal goals include keeping a small, agile team, as well as
integrating with external project developers and the customer.

We will look at both the day-to-day and the less frequent challenges we meet:

<ul>
<li>communication
<li>keeping customer applications up-to-date on a moving platform
<li>educating
<li>bridging the gap of operational responsibilities in a multi-party project
<li>negotiating trade-offs
<li>communication
<li>in-house production depth
<li>managing deployments
<li>interfacing with corporate legal and financial requirements
<li>helping customers consume the operational flexibility they ask for
<li>communication
<li>infrastructure and platform development
<li>FLOSS community interactions
<li>growing with no silver bullet
<li>trusting our instincts
</ul>

Our talk will substantiate our experiences based on reliable anecdotal
evidence from real, ongoing customer projects.

**Speaker:**

Christian Theune, Christian Kauhaus
