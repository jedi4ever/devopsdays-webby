title: "Culture First!"

**Abstract:**

In this presentation we would like to share our experience of building a team
which employed DevOps methodology to build the software and all underlying
infrastructure from ground up, with continous integration, delivery,
monitoring, logging, scalability and availability in mind for different stages.
We believe that the culture and inner collaborating of the team are the key
points to achieve a success.

The question we would be answering in this presentation are

- How to build a team with DevOps methodology
- What kind of culture needs to be in place for this methodology to be effective
- Who does what? Tasks such as monitoring, logging,dashboard, etc. are tasks of Dev or Ops?
- how does the team solves the problems? Can we use traditional approaches such as pair programming?
- how to integrate infrastructure work into agile methods such as scrum
- how to establish collaboration between Dev and ops?
