title: "Why mobile and front-end developers will love you for having continuous deployment and integration set up"
---

**Abstract:**

Deploying the back-end architecture to support a mobile application can be a
daunting and repetitive task but thanks to different tools such as Docker and
Tutum we can automate that process into a deployment pipeline. That is, you
only have to set it up once and then it will automatically re-deploy the app to
a staging or production server when new commits are detected in a particular
GitHub repository. But how far do you have to go to keep your team happy?

This will not only make your life as the DevOps easier but also your whole team
happier. This lightning talk will focus on the team dynamics and how to keep
mobile and front-end developers happy and less on the technical aspect of the
task at hand.
