**Abstract:**

In the past 4 years, PAYBACK technologies has started its devops journey,
turned left & right a few times - and achieved goals that some people thought
were not possible.

During the course of the presentation we will look back at where PAYBACK was
and where it is today.  PAYBACK technologies works in large scale enterprise
world, with corporate datacentres, ITIL process and carried with it a sizable
amount of technical debt. Everyone here realises we're not perfect but in the
past years we've made significant progress.

During the presentation we will look at how we switched to deployment
automation with 48 artefacts, our battles with tool choices, how we've spread
the message for culture, improved our monitoring - and where we see ourselves
going in the next 4-5 years.
