title: "Immutable infrastructure with NixOps"
---

**Abstract:**

Immutable infrastructure is a term to describe the practice of not making
configuration changes directly on servers, but in contrast automate
configuration changes (continuously) using tools like Chef, Pupper or in
our case NixOps.

NixOps is a tool for deploying sets of NixOS Linux machines, either to real
hardware or to virtual machines. It extends NixOSâ€™s declarative approach to
system configuration management to networks and adds provisioning.

NixOS is a Linux distribution with a unique approach to package and
configuration management. Built on top of the Nix package manager, it is
completely declarative, makes upgrading systems reliable.

Declarative specs and safe upgrades make NixOS a great system for DevOps
use. NixOps, the NixOS cloud deployment tool, allows you to provision and
manage networks of NixOS machines in environments like Amazon EC2,
VirtualBox, ...
