title: "Because your Infrastructure Deserves Tests, Too: Test-Driven Infrastructure with Test Kitchen, Serverspec and RSpec"
---

**Abstract:**

The goal of Continuous Delivery is, briefly, to get features into your users'
or customers' hands as quickly as possible. In order to succeed, Development
and Operations teams need to align and come up with both working and deployable
software in short, regular intervals. Chef, Puppet, Ansible & Co. enable teams
to code up application runtime environments, but alone do not allow for
building quality into their processes. In this talk I will show how you can
apply the "Red, Green, Refactor Cycle" of Test-Driven Development and combine
it with your configuration management or orchestration tool of choice in order
to come up with better infrastructure that can automatically be tested using
Test Kitchen, Docker, Serverspec and RSpec.
