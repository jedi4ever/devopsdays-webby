title: "DevOps@Enterprise - Lessons from the Trenches"
---

**Abstract:**

The tricky part to implement a DevOps strategy is that there
is no manual telling you exactly how to do it, and hence we have to
experiment and continuously adapt the strategy until it suits your specific
needs. This situation looks even worse on the Enterprise, where different
departments need to collaborate, be aware and informed of whats going on.
This presentation aims to show how to establish the strategy, identify key
stakeholders, disseminate the culture and implement a continuous
improvement process on the Enterprise, even better, we will give you a
detailed view of how the DevOps strategy on one of the majors banks in
Brazil evolved from Continuous Integration to a fully-fledged DevOps
environment.
