title: "How to run one of the top 100 US websites from Germany"
---

**Abstract:**

Within three years, Berlin based startup moviepilot.com became the largest
US site around movies. With a small team of developers and ops we decided -
contrary to all advice - to host the website on cheap servers in Germany.

In this talk, moviepilot’s CTO is going to give an overview on the
infrastructure and our learnings on what did work well and what did not. We
will talk about tech, hosting costs and give advice on how to bootstrap an
international high traffic site from Germany.


**Speaker:**
