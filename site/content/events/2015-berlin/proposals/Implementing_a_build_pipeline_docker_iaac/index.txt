title: "Implementing a build pipeline with Docker and Infrastructure-as-Code"
---

**Abstract:**

I will start with an existing build job (probably Maven) and define a build
pipeline in Jenkins with Workflow DSL. I will show how to easily use Docker
inside Jenkins workflow for running the builds and various tests.

This will only use Jenkins OSS features to avoid vendor pitching.

I think that many people are using traditional job definitions in Jenkins. I
want to show how much easier and more maintainable it is to switch to an
Infrastructure-as-Code model with the Jenkins Workflow DSL.
