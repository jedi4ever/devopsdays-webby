title: "Monitoring Java applications in Docker container with Jolokia and InfluxDB"
---

**Abstract:**

Monitoring Java applications with JMX can only be done with
another Java process, we all know this.  Roland Huss has created Jolokia to
make JMX metrics available without using another Java process. In the age
of Docker there is also the problem with exposing the right ports to
monitor with JMX and this is where Jolokia is useful too. With
check_jmx4perl there exists a posibillity to use Jolokia together with
Nagios. But there is at the moment no way to use Jolokia together with
InfluxDB or Graphite. In this talk I will give an introduction into Jolokia
and jmx4perl, compare standard JMX monitoring with using Jolokia and Demo
using a simple application how to get metrics values from Jolokia to
InfluxDB.
