title: "Supercharge your development environment using Docker"
---

**Abstract:**

The idea of this talk is to convey how important it is that we have our
development environment as close to production as possible.

These days applications are getting more and more complex. It's becoming quite
difficult to keep track of all the different components an application needs
to function (a database, an AMQP, a web server, a document store...). It keeps
getting harder and harder to setup new development environments and to bring
new developers into the team. Stuff works on one dev machine but doesn't on
others? Code breaks often when deployed to production even though all tests
were passing and it worked on the dev machine?

In this talk I am going to show how to utilize light weight containers using
docker, and make your development process much more straightforward. How to
share container images among your development team and be sure that everyone
is running the exact same stack. Do all this without hogging too many
resources, without the need for complex provisioning scripts and management
systems. And above all else, how to do it fast!
