title: "The beauty and the bias: A tale of self-delusion and fallacy"
---

**Abstract:**

It is well-understood that in order to get the most out of a framework,
developers must be aware of its tradeoffs and shortcomings.

However, the greatest challenge in tighly-knit technical teams - as
encouraged by DevOps - is of a more social than technical nature. The
root issue this difficulty stems from is somewhat well-understood by
perception theory and psychology. At its core lies the fact that the
human mind is the product of a long evolutionary timeline - one might
go as far as calling it legacy. As a consequence, we are driven by
certain patterns of thought and behaviour that were very much adequate
while living in caves. But it goes without saying that some of these
are no longer appropriate and sometimes even harmful.

Some examples:

* The *illusion of asymmetric insight* makes it all too easy to believe
  that we are promoting diversity while we are actually forming closed
  groups and excluding other opinions simply because they are not our
  own. Thwarting this misconception is tremendously important in
  heterogenous groups of people with different mindsets.

* *Ego depletion* is the observation that, contrarily to common belief,
  willpower is a finite resource. Understanding this limitation can
  allow for better self-discipline. This comes in handy while
  broadening one's technical skills but also for self-improvement in
  general.

This talk assumes that to be at our best, we also need to be aware of
the tradeoffs and shortcomings of the human mind. In order to achieve
this, this talk will explore common thought patterns and fallacies
leading to bias, misunderstanding and self-delusion.
