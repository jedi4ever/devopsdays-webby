title: "Containers, DevOps, Apache Mesos and Cloud - Reshaping how we Develop and Delivery Software"
---

**Abstract:**

Container technology are being evaluated by software
developers and administrators with a great deal of interest. Developers
want to focus on what they do best: Creating and coding new applications.
That shouldn't have to change just because they need to deploy an
application to a different environment. Administrators want the environment
to stay reliable and stable, keeping changes at a minimum. By following a
strategy that embraces good Architecture, use of Containers, DevOps
philosophy, Apache Mesos and a Cloud based environment, developers and
operators can create, consume and collaborate on the infrastructure
configuration over the time, deploy Java EE applications and test your
application infrastructure consistently regardless of the stage of the
development life cycle.
