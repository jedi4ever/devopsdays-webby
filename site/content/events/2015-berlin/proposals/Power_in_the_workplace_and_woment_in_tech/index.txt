title: "Power in the workplace and women in tech - interdependencies for successful alliances"
---

**Abstract:**

When you look at working environments, different manifestations of power are
omnipresent. Without power, work would probably not be done, at least not as
efficient as we are used to it. But what exactly is power?

There are different aspects to power and definitively no such thing as “good”
or “bad” power, since both can be used in a good and in a not-so-good way.
Furthermore, power is different to mere enforcement. And, if used in a wise
way, power can be vital to organizations.

I would like to be talking about different types of power and how power can be
used for a collaborative working atmosphere, which empowers women and leads to
more diverse teams. I will also stress the link between power and leadership
and how both should interact to create sustainable, diverse and successful
teams.
