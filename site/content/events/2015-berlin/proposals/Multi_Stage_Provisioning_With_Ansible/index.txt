title: "Multi-Stage Provisioning with Ansible"
---

**Abstract:**

How to configure your server landscape is always difficult. You have servers of
different kinds, like web servers and database servers on the one hand and you
have different stages, like "development" and "production" on the other. Puppet,
Chef and Ansible simplify such configuration, but you really need a clear model
of what you want to achieve and how to map that to the capabilities of your
toolbox. Ansible is easy to learn and your playbooks can become powerful very
fast. But it is not so obvious how to model multiple "stages" with Ansible.

In this talk a very quick overview of Ansible is given and different solutions
to handle multi-stage provisioning are explained and contrasted with the
mechanisms of Puppet and Chef. It is not a comparison, in the sense: what is
best -- but simply a comparison of the models and mechanisms of these tools in
a certain (important) dimension.
