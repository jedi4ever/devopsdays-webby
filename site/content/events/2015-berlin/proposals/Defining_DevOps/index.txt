title: "Defining DevOps"
---

**Abstract:**

The purpose of this talk is to define, by trying to decipher, the current
meaning and perception of DevOps. While a big interest towards adopting the
DevOps philosophy has been shown, especially the last year, there is still a
huge struggle in understanding what is really needed to take this step, from
using the right tools and hiring the write people, to adopting an agile
mentality and swifting towards a completely new model, where cross-functional
teams come to replace the old and strictly layered IT departments, which are
still really tough to shake. In the end, it is crucial to understand how this
new approach is there to achieve one very specific thing; help your team and
company become more efficient in achieving its targets by using the benefits of
the tools and the knowledge brought by what we today call DevOps.

Description: 

The proposed talk will go through what DevOps describes when it
comes to tools, techniques and technologies, what it is asked by a company, and
a candidate, when a new DevOps position is opened, and finally how the
aforementioned come together to shape a philosophy and a mentality, which needs
to be adopted by the whole team, that will eradicate the dysfunctionalities of
nowadays IT departments and create a healthier and more effective workflow and
environment.
