title: "DevOps and Security"
---

**Abstract:**

IT infrastructure is becoming more diverse than ever. Current application
deployments range from bare-metal installations to cloud environments and
containers infrastructures. At the same time, companies in competitive markets
need to ship features and applications faster.

On top of managing the core infrastructure, it is very challenging to manage
security and compliance baselines. By using DevOps, companies are able to
incorporate security measures at all stages of development, deployment, and
operations. New approaches allow us to share the same verification tests across
all expert groups and to automate security hardening via DevOps. In this talk,
I will walk you through the steps to increase your security baseline.

**Speaker:**
