title: "The TICK stack or how I got to love InfluxDB"
---

**Abstract:**

The TICK stack are 4 pieces of software from the  makers of
InfluxDB. The T stands for Telegraf a daemon which collects metrics and
sends them to InfluxDB, I is for InfluxDB a metrics database, C is for
Chronograf which is used to build graphs from InfluxDB data and K is still
in stealth mode. All tools have two properties in common they are really
simple to setup and really flexibel to use. For this reason the stack can
be used to analyse problems, show performance improvements and get a
feeling for your application right from the beginning. In this presentation
I want give a short introduction into each tool and setup all of them using
a simple example. And if we are in luck a can also show the K.
