**Abstract:**

What have Open Source, an Agile Mindset and DevOps in common? The right
combination of those topics creates a new base for cooperation in IT.

A review of the last 6 years at ImmobilienScout24 shows how our IT
department advanced by implementing them in practice. Especially our cloud
migration benefits from the open culture in the company and the larger IT
community.
