title: "Empowering developers at Mapbox with a DevOps culture"
---

**Abstract:**

At Mapbox around 60 globally-distributed developers work
on online and batch applications, running hundreds of instances at
AWS, answering hundreds of millions of requests and processing
terabytes of data each day. All developer fully own their software's
lifecycle. We've developed own tools and processes to aid with
development and see broad collaboration there. In this talk I will
explain how we organize our work, which cultural and technical
decisions we made and what challenges we struggle with. There will be
no silver bullets, but honest experiences.

**Speaker:**
Johan Uhle
