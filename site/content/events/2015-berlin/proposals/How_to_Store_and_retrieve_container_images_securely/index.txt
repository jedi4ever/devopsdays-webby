title: "How to store and retrieve container images securely"
---

**Abstract:**

When Docker, rkt or Kubernetes executes your containers, they first
have to download the container images from a repository, a hub or a
web server. How can you be sure that the containers you execute are
really the ones you want and not an image that has been altered?

I will talk first about how Docker images and Application Container
Images (ACIs, used by rkt) are built and who you have to trust when a
container image has multiple layers.

Then I will talk about how the images are downloaded and verified by
the appc discovery protocol (in rkt) or by Docker Notary, involving
HTTPS, cryptographic hashes and GPG signatures.
