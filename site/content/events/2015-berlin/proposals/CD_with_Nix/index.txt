title: "Continuous Development with Nix"
---

**Abstract:**

Continuous development is an umbrella term for several iterable development
cycles, including continuous integration, continuous delivery, continuous
testing and continuous deployment.

Nix is a powerful package manager for Linux and other Unix systems that
makes package management reliable and reproducible. It provides atomic upgrades
and rollbacks, side-by-side installation of multiple versions of a package,
multi-user package management and easy setup of build environments.

Why would somebody even touch package management in 2015? Current package
management never fails us, right? What does package management has to do with
Continuous development?

Any successful project at one point will have to be shared or redistributed,
most likely to paying customers. Current tools at our disposal make this very
expensive, if not altogether impossible.

What I would like to show (and hopefully convince you) is that not only
packaging is possible in small teams (startups), but is actually one of the
points where whole development process can be optimized.
