title: "Zero Downtime Deployment with Ansible"
---

**Abstract:**

Ansible is a radically simple and lightweight provisioning framework which
makes your servers and applications easier to provision and deploy. By
orchestrating your application deployments you gain benefits such as
documentation as code, testability, continuous integration, version control,
refactoring, automation and autonomy of your deployment routines, server- and
application configuration. Ansible uses a language that approaches plain
English, uses SSH and has no agents to install on remote systems. It is the
simplest way to automate and orchestrate application deployment, configuration
management and continuous delivery.

In this talk I will give a brief introduction to Ansible and explain how to
provision Linux servers with a web-proxy, a database and some other packages.
Furthermore we will automate zero downtime deployment of a Java application to
a load balanced environment using the expand contract pattern to mitigate the
pain of database upgrades.

We will cover how to provision servers with:

* an application user
* a PostgreSQL database
* Nginx with a load balanced reverse proxy
* an init script installed as a service
* zero downtime deployment of an application that uses the provisioned infrastructure
