title: "Infrastructure as code - Ansible, how to make your life easier!"
---

**Abstract:**

In this presentation we would like to show how to use Ansible in an
effective way to solve problems such as infrastructure testing, continous
integration for infrastructure, staging as well as some of the best
practices of how to use Ansible. Ansible is a very easy to use and learn,
but just because of this it is very often used badly. If infrastructure is
code, than this code must be treated with same care and standards as other
software. Therefore we will not only be focusing on the solution but the
quality of the solution as well.


In our presentation, we will show:

- how to test the infrastructure
- how to use continuous integration for infrastructure code
- how to handle staging
- Ansible roles : how to handle internal roles and open source roles?
- Infrastructure code : how to turn everything in to variables
