title: "How Docker and Consul is used for development and production"
---

**Abstract:**

DevOps and automation go hand in hand. We automated each step from the
source code to the hosting facility with GoCD and Docker. Even the build
process is completely dockerized and can run everywhere. We do not only
build Java artifacts anymore. Our deliverables at the end of the build
process are Docker images. This allows us to be language-, technology- and
platform-agnostic. The images which are generated are tested in the
pipeline too. To accomplish this we spin up a smaller version of the
production environment on the fly. As those infrastructure instances are
ephemeral and dynamic, we use Consul as the service directory for this
environment. We make no difference between test and production
environments. When tests are completed successfully, the image is
automatically deployed to the hosting facility. This strategy offers even
more benefits. It's allows the developers to develop and test code in the
production environment. This way of working improved and revolutionized the
complete development-, build- and rollout-process.

We will show and talk about this process, how we got rid of properties, are
hoster-agnostic and used the same images for development and production.
