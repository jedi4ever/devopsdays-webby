title: "Let's have a DevOps team!"
---

**Abstract:**

Can it help your organization to create DevOps teams? This is a quite
controversial question. One one hand many experts are not tired to point out
there should not never ever be such a thing as a DevOps team. On the other hand
many organization try out to form DevOps teams, at least as an intermediate
step of a long-term transformation of their organizational structure.

I am a guy who formed such a DevOps team inside an enterprise, and over the
course of four years we had the chance to learn a lot. In this talk we cover
the advantages — how this helped our organization on its journey to become more
agile — as well as the disadvantages and challenges.
