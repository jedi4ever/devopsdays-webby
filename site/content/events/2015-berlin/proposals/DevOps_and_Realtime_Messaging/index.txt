title: "DevOps and Realtime Messaging: Running your XMPP messaging at scale using Saltstack and Docker"
---

**Abstract:**

At the end of the talk you should have a fairly good grasp of how to
reliably and repeatedly build and deploy and scale your own realtime
messaging infrastructure using XMPP.

The first half of this talk will cover realtime messaging approaches and
then look at how XMPP works and how to run your own XMPP server.

The talk then covers considerations for scaling XMPP to millions of
simultaneous users. The talk draws on experience of the Buddycloud team
building and running the Buddycloud hosted environment.

The second half of the talk looks at automation strategies and the pros and
cons of Docker and why we switched over to using Saltstack to manage the
Buddycloud XMPP and server environment. We'll show code snippets from the
Buddycloud infrastructure and cover how we solved automation challenges.
