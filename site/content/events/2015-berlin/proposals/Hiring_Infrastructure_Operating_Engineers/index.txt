title: "Hiring Infrastructure Operations Engineers"
---

**Abstract:**

What are some of the strategies you should consider when you hire an
Infrastructure Operations Engineer? What should you consider if you are
looking to join a company.

I will talk through the evolution of the hiring process that I have driven
at a large publicly listed Australian company detailing the optimisations
to that process along the way.

Hopefully the talk will be really light hearted but drive the message of
always refine your hiring process as you refine the role and
responsibilities of your roles.

Some of the content will be based around [my blog](http://www.mysqldbahelp.com/2015/08/how-to-hire-for-infrastructure.html
) on the topic.

**Speaker:**
Trent Hornibrook
