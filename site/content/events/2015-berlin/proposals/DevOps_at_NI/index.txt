**Abstract:**

Introducing automation into NI's development and operations
We will present an overview of how we have been introducing automation
and DevOps methodologies at NI. First from a birds eye view
perspective and then diving deeper into a couple of specific areas.

Salt strategies

An insight into the problems and challenges we have faced and overcome
with the following:

- secrets management
- deployment authorisation
- secure configuration management

Having selected Salt as our weapon of choice, we will share our
experiences.

DevOps, Architectures & Agile

How we have used gradual specification and incremental implementation
to build large scale infrastructure in small scale sprints.

**Speaker:**
Callum MacGregor
