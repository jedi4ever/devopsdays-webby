title: "Automating Data Deployments with Distributed Databases"
---

**Abstract:**

A typical approach to constructing a data store for applications has been
adding functionality to a central database as and when required. This works to
a point, but over time this gets harder for DevOps teams to scale and manage,
with replication and synchronisation of data increasingly more complex and
fraught.

Distributed databases help solve the scaling side of this problem, allowing for
simple adding and removing of database nodes as demand dictates.

In this presentation I will show:

- How to set-up a Distributed Database and the options available.
- How re-synchronisation, balancing and indexing of data works as the number of nodes in a cluster changes.
- Constructing a cluster spread across data-centres and geographical regions
