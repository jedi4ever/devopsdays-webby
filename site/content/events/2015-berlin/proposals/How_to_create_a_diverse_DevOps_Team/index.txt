title: "How to Create a Diverse DevOps Team"
---

**Abstract:**

Creating a diverse engineering team is challenging for many reasons. First,
you must decide what “diversity” means to your tech organization, and how
broadly you wish to define the term. Next: Given your resources, how can
you find enough candidates to build a team that fits your definition?

Lastly: How do you create a work environment where each member feels they
can be themselves, and where management contributes? In this talk, I will
offer insights and answers so that you can start advocating successfully
for more diversity in your tech organization. I will describe steps Zalando
has taken to increase diversity in tech, including our Diversity Guild (a
self-organized group of Zalando technologists and People & Organization/HR
professionals who promote diversity internally); open hiring policies
(technologists from 50 nations and counting); and relocation services.

Finally, I will discuss recent research suggesting what works — and what
doesn’t — when trying to increase diversity in the tech workplace.
