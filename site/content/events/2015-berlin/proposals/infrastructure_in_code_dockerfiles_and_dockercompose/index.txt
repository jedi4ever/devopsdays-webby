title: "Infrastructure in Code - DockerFiles and Docker Compose"
---

**Abstract:**

The growth in Virtualisation and Containers is helping us replace a lot of our
network infrastructure with discrete, ephemeral components and micro-services.

In this presentation I will introduce you to a DockerFile, a way of describing
an individual container, a set of commands for creating a Container. This will
specifically cover:

- Finding existing Docker images to use and extending them
- Triggering commands on a container
- Setting environment variables
- Exposing ports that a container may need
- Copying files to a container
- Submitting your own images to the Docker hub

I will demonstrate how DockerFiles can be supplemented with Docker Compose to
create complex, inter-connected application stacks that can be created, deleted
and updated with simple one-line commands. I will specifically cover:

- Compose equivalents to DockerFile options
- Linking containers
- Selecting local or remote images
