**Abstract:**

In the old days, everything in Ops land was about control.

Now, developers try to take over, introducing every hype technology they
come across, burning bridges where they find them, revelling in the
self-created chaos. Speed increases, resilience increases, everything is
automated. But is it really? Can you re-create all your services? Even
when people leave?

A call for responsible technology use and automation
