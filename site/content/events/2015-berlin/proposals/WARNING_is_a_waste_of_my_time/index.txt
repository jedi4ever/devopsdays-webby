title: "WARNING is a waste of my time"
---

**Abstract:**

How many log levels do you know? How many log levels are actually useful?
What is the practical difference between WARNING and NOTICE?

I believe that in a world of automation, I need only two log levels:

ERROR and everthing else.

ERROR means that I as a human should take action. Everything else is
irrelevant for me. All the other log levels are IMHO a remnant of the past
from the last century. This ignite talk looks at the WARNING problem from
both a Dev and an Ops perspective in order to find a useful definition for
the age of automation.
