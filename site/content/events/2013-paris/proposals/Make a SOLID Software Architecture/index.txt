**Abstract:**

Starting with Chef or Puppet as a System Administrator will lead you
to a problem where you are not sure what’s the best solution of a
problem in terms of software architecture.

We will give you a brief overview of general well known and battle
tested software patterns which also applies to infrastructure
management code. We’ll also show Antipatterns and best practices.
