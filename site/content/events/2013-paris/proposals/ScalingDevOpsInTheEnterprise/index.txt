**Abstract:**

Although DevOps is one of the hot topics for C-level executives, a lot of initiatives fail or don’t produce value for an organization. However, the roll-out of Agile methodologies increases the pressure on development and operations to improve the ability to take new applications and features into production.

The session describes a tool-independent blueprint of a successful DevOps reference implementation in a large multi-national organization, highlighting the key factors that are necessary and how organizations can transform their infrastructure re-using the different capabilities they already have.

*Rainer Heinold, Senior Technical Director EMEA, CollabNet, Inc.*
