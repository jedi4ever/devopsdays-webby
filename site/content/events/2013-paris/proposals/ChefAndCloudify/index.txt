title: Building your own OpsWorks with Chef and Cloudify
platinum: true
---

**Abstract:**

AWS OpsWorks is a DevOps solution for managing applications of any scale or complexity on the AWS cloud. With OpsWorks you can manage your complete application lifecycle, including resource provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, software updates, monitoring, etc. However, OpsWorks is only applicable to AWS. What if you could create and manage a similar service on top of any cloud? In this session we will introduce Cloudify, a new open source PaaS framework. Cloudify takes a different approach by using recipes (as opposed to heavyweight coding and platform extension) as a means to introduce new application stacks to the PaaS layer. You can think of it as extending the recipe model of Chef to support application level concerns such as orchestration, dependency management, multi-tier and multi-host deployments, monitoring and auto-scaling. This session will introduce how Cloudify leverages Chef as a key enabler for an open PaaS framework.
