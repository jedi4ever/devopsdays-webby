title: How Axway uses Native Packages to motorize its Forges chains?
---

**Abstract:**

Major Linux distributions use native packages, RPM or DEB, for many years now.

With a strong support of pre-requisites, application life-cyle (install, update, removal), Native Packaging help sysadmins to carefully control applications and system lifecycle.

Native packages are perfectly suited for any applications, on premise or cloud based.
And they could be used with Puppet/Chef tooling, managing the hard part, aka componenting/packaging part, freeing our Puppet/Chef Master from complex recipes.

In 2012, Axway ECD Team started to create a rich catalog of Forge solutions like Jenkins, Artifactory, Nexus, Archiva, Jira, Confluence but also Subversion or Git to provide "CI as service" to Dev and QA teams.

This talk will present what have been done, RPMs, Packages factory using Jenkins and ESXi, Dev/QA/Prod silos, staging/promotion and internal yum repositories for world-wide deliveries.

We'll dig into some packages to see how Dev and Ops should communicate to ensure solution will met runtime environment constraints.

After 6 months in production, this implementation story demonstrate that some good old solutions could meet recent paradigms like DevOps and both fit really nicely
