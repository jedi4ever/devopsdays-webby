---

**Abstract:**

This talk takes the perspective the business customers of the development operations process: product managers, marketers, and decision makers who rely on effective development operations process to rev the ship frequency, scope and quality of their products.


For these stakeholders, automated development operations is about more than clean, well tested and reviewed code shipped quickly. It's about making on-boarding of new engineers easy, by flattening the learning curve to get them productive in a new environment.


It's about being able to shift cloud providers on a dime based on pricing and traffic. It's about helping management understand if it's product and business strategies are effective by translating learning from user behavior on a site/application back to issues, bugs and eventually fixes to the code and changes to product design.


The talk is directed and developers, systems administrators who use and/or set up DevOps systems, to help them asses the ROI on dev automation and make the case to management that effective DevOps can be a critical competitive differentiator for a firm.
