**Abstract:**

The new buzz world in the world of Agile is "Dev Ops". So what exactly is devOps and Why do we need it?

When development got married to deployment (sys-admin/operations) ; what is born is a new advanced species which is known to us today as "Dev Ops".

So we get developers who are concerned about operations, deployments, builds. And we have the operational guys writing code to deploy and get infrastructure up and running!! Isn't it amazing?

But, Seriously? Thats it? Whats more? How do they do it? And more importantly; Why?


Lets take a dive into it. Here we will discuss :

* Why ?
* Mindset
* Continuous Delivery
* Infrastructure as Code
* Small demo of Chef

The talk would be around [my blog](http://xebee.xebia.in/index.php/2013/08/08/devops-demystified/).
