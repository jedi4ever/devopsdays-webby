**Abstract:**

*_ Raguel : Cleaner Shell Scripting _*

> Why mostly people avoid Shell Scripting?
>
> * It's ugly, a mess to maintain and easy to miss out on all constructs.
>
> * In almost every implementations, never tested.

> Why still people sometimes depend on Shell Scripts?
>
> * For initial system bootstrap in case awesome PXE style is not to support.
>
> * For general small system tasks where a full configuration management suite seems overkill.

For example, if I keep spawning new Virtual Machines often and my requirement is to get a specific package upgraded on it and grab output of some commands to confirm correct behavior.

Would I be interested in getting a powerful multi-featured config. management suite to first install, get setup and then perform all this.
Or if just a "trustworthy clean maintainable" shell script can perform this minor task quickly, would I select that path.

If the answer is latter, here will be a quick demo of how. And also how to have tests for that too.
