title: "Why Monitoring is a Perfect Example of DevOps"
---

**Abstract:**

I work as a developer for a monitoring platform in Yahoo. Over the course of 5 years, I have been exposed to the best of both worlds in Devs and Ops. Indeed without the synergies of Dev and Ops, it is impossible to get a monitoring platform or product right.

In this particular talk, I will talk about how developing a monitoring platform challenges your limits as a developer and also how working in isolation as a developer without a strong understanding of Ops can mean that your monitoring product can turn out to be pretty useless.

I will discuss some of the very interesting developer challenges that a monitoring platform has to address (collection at scale, aggregation at scale, correlation of alerts and events etc.).

I will also discuss on why you also need to be passionate about Ops to create a great and robust monitoring product.
