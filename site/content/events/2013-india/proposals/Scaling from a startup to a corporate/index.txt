title: "Scaling from a Startup to a Corporate"
---

**Abstract:**

How to scale a small startup having around 10 server to an organization with a few hundred to thousands of server. The challenges faced by devops in this scaling and probable solutions to these challenges.

Below is a outline of things I would like to talk about: 

* Why hire devops rather that separate developers and operations team?
* Invest in automation
* Encourage internet search
* Build monitoring early
* Never do over-logging
* Pick the right vendors, bargain, try out new things
* Encourage open source early
* Have a spine, you'll have long battles with almost everything
