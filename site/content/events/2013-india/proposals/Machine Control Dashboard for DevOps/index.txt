title: "Machine Control Dashboard for DevOps"
---

**Abstract:**

Been toying for some time with the idea of putting together a dashboard in physical form as during the early industrial days. #monitoringsucks

With the help of some switches / gears and a Arduino connected to a backend or a raspberry-pi acting as one, one can very well do all devops activities.

Imagine a dashboard (as image below) being used for monitoring RAM / CPU / build status et all.

Push a bottom and there your latest build deployed.

This is more of a thought experiment and a small prototype that I built.

Also some other ideas on devops like lighting up a red bulb at office (aka operation theater) when the site goes down etc.
