title: "10 Deployments a day - A brief on extreme release protocols"
---

**Abstract:**

A reflection on how we migrated from an era of production deployments once a week to more than 10 deployments a day. The story of transforming a mere sys-admin to super sophisticated DevOps team, armed with multiple tools, scripts and plugins for achieving automations, accuracy and invincible agility. As we continue on our endeavor for further improvisation, I believe its worth sharing the experience with community.
Tentative topics outline:

* Arming teams for their transformation to DevOps from mere sys-admins.

* Killing manual deployments (manual deployment->capistrano->webistrano)

* Automation
> * for daily backups
> * monitoring applications and servers
> * deploying dependencies

* Saving up time on setting up new instances(using golden image).

* Using LDAP to maintain servers with public key(avoiding individual logins to every server makes it less messy)

* Using Puppet for instantiating multiple servers at once.

* Commissioning our own Cloud Infrastructure.
