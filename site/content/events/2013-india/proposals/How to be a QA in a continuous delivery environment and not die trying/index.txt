title: "How to be a QA in a continuous delivery environment and not die trying"
---

**Abstract:**

From requirements definition to deploying to production, QA is involved in the whole process, but what is exactly their role? How can we prevent them becoming a bottleneck in the process? Is QA only about monkey testing?
I’ll show the different roles of QA people and what they do in the different stages of development and release process.
