**Abstract:**

*_ OpenStack Is More Than Just OpenStack _*


OpenStack as mostly is projected an OSS running Big IaaS for all. It's True.

But it's just the bigger Truth, surrounded with many smaller ones.

OpenStack is made of several other components than just Compute side, which end-up in background supporting Compute facility.

Here I'll quickly discuss how other components are useful in their own way and have far greater potential than just supporting the mighty Compute.
