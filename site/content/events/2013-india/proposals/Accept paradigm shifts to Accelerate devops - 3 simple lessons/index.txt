title: "Accept paradigm shifts to Accelerate devops - 3 simple lessons"
---

**Abstract:**

In the beginning, it just works
As we scale, it may break.

This holds true for both software development and devops.
Let's admit it, devops is not easy especially when companies grow.
We need to experiment and reinvent ourselves while we adopt devops for the organization we are part of.

Things could have been easier if one way of doing devops fits all.
While we all agree that devops is not an end but a journey, the journey may warrant paradigm shifts to be an effective one.

In this ignite talk,  I would like to propose a few paradigm shifts which may accelerate the devops journey.

**Speaker:**
Habeeb Rahman, Apigee
