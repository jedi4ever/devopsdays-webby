# How a payment processing company turned into a software release factory

## Abstract

There was a company which had typical long running releases and the business was not happy. Business wanted change but IT was not sure how to deliver. Then they heard about Agile. It looked like the magic potion to all their problems.They started doing Agile but it just meant more work for the team and a chaos during the last days of the sprint. Operations was still not happy. Then they heard about another magic potion called Devops, which forced them to think about continuous delivery.  I'll talk about the various tools being used in order to bring about this change and what were the challenges that they faced in this journey.The talk has two dimensions: First, The tool chain and Second, how the team was convinced to hop on this journey of continuos delivery. Let me begin by saying that both of the points are equally important and correlated because convincing a team to change is very difficult if the tool selection is not right. I'll also get into a demo of the working pipeline using this toolset.
