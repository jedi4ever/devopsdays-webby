# State Of The 'DevOps' Union

## Abstract

This presentation covers the current state of the Devops movement as presented by one of the original "Core Organizers" of the movement.  The presentation will look at some of the taxonomies that have been used to describe Devops such as CAMS and ICE.  It will also cover the recent 2015 Devops Survey and we will end up with a discussion about how Devops is being adopted in the enterprise.
