# Life at REA Group - Lessons from 7 years of DevOps

## _From hiring the right people to running distributed teams._


## Abstract

REA Group is the parent company of one of the most popular Australian websites - [realestate.com.au](http://www.realestate.com.au/).

Over the past 7 years REA Group has scaled from a 30 odd IT workforce to 200 across multiple locations.

From Waterfall to Agile. From archaic to an employer of choice.

Over my 7 years at REA we have lessons which I’d love to share on

- Hiring Operations and Developers
- Getting Operations and Developers to collaborate
- Optimising teams to be more effective
- Overcoming cultural differences in a distributed team - particularly Asian and Western cultures
- How to knowledge share technical information across the entire company

## Speaker
Trent Hornibrook, Delivery Lead at [REA](http://www.realestate.com.au/)

## Bio
In Australia, one of the most trafficked Australian websites is realestate.com.au - a real estate portal similar to iproperty.com.sg in Singapore.

I have worked for [realestate.com.au](http://www.realestate.com.au/) ([REA](http://www.realestate.com.au/)) for the past 7 years from joining as a Systems Administrator in 2008 to becoming an Operations Lead in 2012. During this time REA has grown and seen significant change - most notably moving from an old school IT waterfall organisation to one of the most progressive agile delivery organisations in Australia. Over the past two years I have transitioned into a Delivery Lead role though still cultivate our Operations and Developers in DevOPS at REA.

The achievements that I am most proud of at REA:

- Driven from grassroots the DevOPS movement within REA that resulted in changes from tools and technology to how the IT part of the organisation is structured
- Built, refined and extended our hiring process for our Operations Engineers within REA
- Built and now running one of the best distributed agile delivery teams at REA located in Xi’an China
