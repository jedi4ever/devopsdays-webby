# About Singapore

If all you know of Singapore is that it is a _fine_ city, you're missing out.
Singapore has many names: The Lion City. The Garden City. The Asian Tiger. The 'Fine' City. All venerable nicknames.

While its importance as the hub ob Asia is undisputed, it is also home
to innovative startups, leading universities, and world-class arts and culture.

If you're local, you already know the diversity of our [DevOps community](http://www.meetup.com/devops-singapore/).
If you're coming in from elsewhere, prepare to mix with DevOps leaders from every segment of
our vibrant local scene around Asean. And, of course, take some time to check out everything else
the S'pore has to offer, from the many museums to great food and drink!

For those coming from out of town, there are flights from just about everywhere to
[Singapore](http://www.changiairport.com/), and there are several hotels nearby. More details
are on the [location page](location).

[Some even say](http://travel.cnn.com/singapore/none/worlds-greatest-city-50-reasons-why-singapore-no-1-399897) it's the 'easiest place for business,' the 'most livable city in Asia' and the 'best city in the world to live in for Asia expatriates.'.

So here are some more facts about Singapore:

## It's going to be HOT!

Singapore is about 137 kilometres (85 mi) north of the equator and thus the DevOpsDays location which is closest to the center of … everything!
Expect a diverse culture and temperatures above 30 degree celsius. We are pretty sure to provide you equally hot topics too.

We recommend to add a few more days to explore the beautiful city and try the delicious foods.

## We help you stay cool!

The aircon and the lovely staff in our venue will help you to stay cool and relaxed. Expect delicious food and supplies. We took great effort in choosing a premium location which adds benefits like easy transportation and the comfort of an integrated Hotel.

## Indulge

If it's edible and fits on a plate, bowl, banana leaf or sheet of paper, you'll find it in Singapore! Head to any of the hawker centers in the heartlands to truly sample Singapore’s food culture. There’s a huge variety of stalls there at dirt-cheap prices. Also around the conference venue.

## Green Builds in Garden City

There's the Botanical Gardens, HortPark, MacRitchie Reservoir, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve which a variety of flora and fauna.

Rows of trees that line roads everywhere, from expressways to suburban streets. Singapore's a champion of environmental initiatives, from the world's largest CNG refueling station to its first Solar Greenlots for electric vehicles.

## Secure Strolling

Singapore has a crime rate so low, ladies stroll without fear in the wee hours of the night. And contrary to Western opinion, there's no strong police presence poised to cane anyone for spitting, chewing gum or scratching cars.

## Superior Shopping

Singapore's stretch of malls accommodate the most fickle shoppers. Shop from Wisma Atrium on one end to Suntec City on the other without feeling the sun.

## English that is so special lah!

Singlish is the unofficial 'first language' of most Singaporeans and one that would bewilder the remaining English-speaking world. It is cobbled together from various influences including Queen's English, Bahasa Melayu, Tamil, dialects such as Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese, Bengali, Punjabi and even a smattering of various other European, Indic and Sinitic languages. Can lah!
