# The Roaring Little Red Dot

Singapore has many names: The Lion City. The Garden City. The Asian Tiger. The S'pore. The 'Fine' City. All venerable nicknames, but our favorite is the 'Little Red Dot'.

That's because Singapore is so small on the world map that the cartographer had to use a red dot to denote the location.

# Singapore = Food

If it's edible and fits on a plate, bowl, banana leaf or sheet of paper, you'll find it in Singapore! Head to any of the hawker centers in the heartlands to truly sample Singapore’s food culture. There’s a huge variety of stalls there at very reasonable prices. Also around the conference venue.

---

# Singapore = Garden City

There's the Botanical Gardens, HortPark, MacRitchie Reservoir, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve which a variety of flora and fauna.

Rows of trees that line roads everywhere, from expressways to suburban streets. Singapore's a champion of environmental initiatives, from the world's largest CNG refueling station to its first Solar Greenlots for electric vehicles.

---

# Singapore = Secure

Singapore has a crime rate so low, ladies stroll without fear in the wee hours of the night. And contrary to Western opinion, there's no strong police presence poised to cane anyone for spitting, chewing gum or scratching cars.

---

# Singapore = Shopping

Singapore's stretch of malls accommodate the most fickle shoppers. Shop from Wisma Atrium on one end to Suntec City on the other without feeling the sun.

---

# English that is so special lah!

Singlish is the unofficial 'first language' of most Singaporeans and one that would bewilder the remaining English-speaking world. It is cobbled together from various influences including Queen's English, Bahasa Melayu, Tamil, dialects such as Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese, Bengali, Punjabi and even a smattering of various other European, Indic and Sinitic languages. Can lah!

---

# Seriously, why it’s worth coming to Singapore?

- First DevOpsDays in Singapore and South East Asia in recent years
- Large IT community (place for spreading DevOps ideas)
- Open minded people with impressive experience
- Interesting key speakers (Germany, USA and Australia)
- Challenging market for DevOps culture (FinOps, Government)
