We greatly value sponsors for this open event and carefully prepared the following <a href="#sponsorship">sponsorship packages</a>. If you are interested in sponsoring please [drop us an email](mailto:<%= render(:partial => "/#{@eventhome}/_email_organizers") %>?subject=Interested in Sponsoring 2015 DevOpsDays Singapore).

## Why Sponsor Us?

The DevOpsDays event mandate is to bring the highest­ quality speakers, experts, and the curious together. This is the first edition of DevopsDays in Singapore and the first in Southeast Asia in recent years.

Singapore is not only one of the fastest growing startup hubs in the world but is also a trusted healthcare, telecom, and financial services nexus in Asia with strong investment in technology from the Government. We aim to attract representation from large enterprises and the startup community alike.

By sponsoring DevOpsDays, you will be exposing your company’s brand and services to Singapore and Southeast Asia’s top talent in this rapidly growing space.

## What is the right sponsor package for you?

### Booth Space

**Gold sponsors** receive booth space at the event. This is the perfect spot for your engineers to meet other tech geeks. Your booth space will have a booth table and two chairs. You can set up your table as you like, be it to display signage, products, materials, or swag giveaways. We encourage sponsors to send engineers to interact with attendees during session breaks and to avoid large displays and heavy marketing materials.

**Silver sponsors** share a swag table where they can lay out printed materials, stickers, or other swag. Since this is a shared table, please be a good neighbor and don’t use up too much of the table.

### One-minute Pitch

Between sessions, Gold Sponsors are given one minute to introduce themselves and their company to the full audience. The moderator will invite a small number to make an introduction during transitions between sessions.

### Evening Event Sponsor

You will be hosting the evening event on Friday night (October 16th) at a location of our choice. You can bring signage to our location and will have one minute to introduce yourself and your company to the full audience.

## Sponsor FAQ

### Can you send me a floor plan?

You can find the floor plan and directions to the venue [here](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1gGrTN0na--0EHj-rBHHOYKf52hpavoNiFMvGqyjl3rw/edit?usp=sharing).

### How big is our booth space?

For Gold Sponsors, you will receive a table (185 x 80 cm) and two chairs that you can decorate as you like.

Silver sponsors share a swag table (185 x 80 cm) where they can lay out printed materials, stickers, or other swag. Since this is a shared table, please be a good neighbor and don’t use up to much of the table.

This is how the standard table looks like:

<img src="../location/venue_table_size.jpg" alt="Table size" width="550">

### When can we pick our booth spot?

Booths are not selectable. Our team will assign your table. Assignments will be made two weeks before the conference date.

You can enter the venue Friday morning at 7:30 am to set up your table.

### How many scanners (and which type) do we get?

None. The booth is a place to talk to people during breaks and this conference is not a typical conference or convention.

We have seen that sponsors benefit the most when they bring engineers to the conference and interact with the attendees during the sessions. You are responsible to collect any information you want in person if you want to do giveaways.

### Can we bring a 1m roll-up as our back wall?

Whatever you bring must fit behind or on your table (185 x 80 cm).

### Will we have any chairs at our booth?

Each booth comes with 2 chairs.

### Will there be a company sign at our booth? When do you need the graphics?

You must bring your own signage and all signage must either fit on or behind the table.

### Do we get any sponsored talks?

No, but you are welcome to submit a proposal for consideration through [our CfP form](http://devopsdays.org/events/2015-singapore/propose/).

### Do we get electricity connection for out booth?

Yes, you will get a power strip (Plug [Type G](http://www.iec.ch/worldplugs/typeG.htm)).

### Will wifi connection be good enough for showing demos?

We do not provide Wifi. Wifi has to be booked as extra on the venue.

### Do we get an advertising in the program? When do you need the graphics?

We will be using the logos that are sent by you.

### Do we get a dedicated email blast?

No, even better: we will give you a Twitter [shout out](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20091205132038AA2uqcy).

### Who should I send?

Not marketing folks. Send your techie geeks that can interact with attendees during the sessions and the breaks.

### Can we get a Platinum sponsorship package?

There is no platinum sponsorship package; however, if you have an awesome idea to support the attendees and us, please let us know!

### How do I pay the sponsorship package?

Invoices will be handled by our conference partner. You will receive an invoice including GST, if applicable.

For this, we need the official business address, full name of your contact and GST number.

### How do we register our sponsor tickets?

Once payment is complete, we will send you an email requesting registration details of the attendees that will use the tickets associated with your sponsorship level.

### How many people do you expect?

We are planning for 150 attendees.

### What kind of attendees will come to the conference?

We are focusing on people who are architecting and building distributed applications or doing migration projects, especially those away from monolithic software. This will typically include Architects, Lead Developers, and IT-Operations.

### Do you have media partners who will cover the conference?

No; however, if you have an idea to support the event in the media, please let us know!

### Can we ship stuff ahead?

Yes. Please send us an email so we can work out the details.

### Can we lock things at the venue during the event?

Yes. There is a shared room where you can stash stuff. Access is organized by the venue itself.

### My question is not covered here. What can I do?

If you have any questions not answered above, please do not hesitate to send us an email at [<%= render(:partial => "/#{@eventhome}/_email_organizers") %>](mailto:<%= render(:partial => "/#{@eventhome}/_email_organizers") %>).
