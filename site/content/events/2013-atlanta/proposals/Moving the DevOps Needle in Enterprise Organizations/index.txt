title: "Moving the DevOps Needle in Enterprise Organizations"
---

**Abstract:**

DevOps has proven itself across many smaller organizations but large enterprises are usually slow to change. It can be a daunting task even identifying where to make changes since there are so many processes and organizational silos to get in the way. As a veteran employee of small, medium, and large enterprises I have figured out ways to drive organizational change based upon getting results. In this presentation I will describe my methods for creating change within and across organizations and provide specific examples of how to begin a meaningful shift towards making DevOps a standard practice within your organization. I'll detail some of the roadblocks to making DevOps a reality and explain how to overcome these obstacles.
