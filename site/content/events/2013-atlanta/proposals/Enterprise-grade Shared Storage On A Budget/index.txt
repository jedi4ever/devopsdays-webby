**Abstract:**

We think SAN storage is correctly viewed as a storage solution 'of last resort', but if you need it, you need it. NAS, iSCSI, and Fiber Channel shared storage solutions from the usual suspects are enormously expensive. How can you acquire (or build) a shared storage solution without breaking the budget? Join us as we share our journey from budget deadlock to designing and deploying an awesome low-cost shared storage solution using NexentaStor 3.x, built on OpenSolaris and the ZFS file system.
