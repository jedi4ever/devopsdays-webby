**Abstract:**

Right now, there is a lot of activity around deploying code to production. Puppet and Chef are fairly widely used and well established. Building custom VMs for cloning is also common. Other options include creating platform specific packages, such as debian packages. Now PaaS is emerging, along with tools such as Docker. Buildpacks, as created by Heroku, are starting to be adopted as the de-facto standard by most PaaS vendors, but there is not yet any open-standard and these work differently across PaaS services. OpenShift uses "cartridges", which is synonymous with buildpacks, but different again. This talk will be a whirlwind review of all these things and more. Leave your favourite rsync args at the door.
