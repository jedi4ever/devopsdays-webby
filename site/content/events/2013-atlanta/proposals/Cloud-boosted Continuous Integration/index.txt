title: "Cloud-boosted Continuous Integration"
---

**Abstract:**

In this session we will describe how we at Ravello Systems use the cloud to supercharge our development process.
As part of this, we will showcase continuous integration on multiple exact replicas of multi-VM production applications in the cloud of your choice, with no resource contention! We will show how this ability radically transforms the day-to-day life of our development, QA, Operations and PM teams, which all utilize the cloud to the extreme.
The variety of tools that we will touch on in this session are Jenkins, maven, chef and more.

**Speaker:**

Gil Hoffer, VP of R&D, Ravello Systems
