title: "Anatomy of an Outage"
---

**Abstract:**


  We deal with outages large and small all the time, and a lot of the troubleshooting involved is based on hunches honed over years of experience. The goal of this presentation is to break down a couple of outages as stories to show how to pick apart the alert that came in for hidden meaning, and then the process of troubleshooting and escalating, and then how to wrap up an ops "event" so it's well-documented and resolved. We'll share tips and tricks we've found over years of dealing with customers' misbehaving Ruby on Rails apps and how we train new employees to deal with outages large and small.
