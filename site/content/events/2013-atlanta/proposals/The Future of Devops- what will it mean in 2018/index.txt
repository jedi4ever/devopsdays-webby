title: “”The Future of Devops: what will it mean in 2018”
---

**Abstract:**

From the first experimental days, Devops has evolved into a relatively mature approach for many tech organizations and has attracted a lot of attention from "Big IT". What will the influx of big vendors and, especially, adoption by large enterprises mean for Devops? What practices and tools will be using in 5 years time? Will Devops split into multiple "schools"? How do we avoid "Devops" becoming another blanket phrase without any real meaning?
