title: "DevOps Metrics Panel"
---

**Abstract:**

Metrics: a standard for measuring or evaluating something, especially one that uses figures or statistics. Regardless of your role 
(Ops, Dev, Batman, etc.), data-driven decision-making is what all the cool kids are doing. But that doesn’t mean they’re doing it 
properly! (except for Batman, 'cause ya know, he's Batman)

As monitoring tools have gotten better and better, metrics of all kinds have become easier and easier to collect, manage, and 
visualize. But are you getting the most out of your metrics? Come listen to our panel of experts (Dave, Boris, Gil … and possibly 
Batman) discuss all aspects of Metrics, including some practical tips on how you can start to use them to promote collaboration 
across the organization.

**Moderator:**

Dave Cliffe (PagerDuty)

**Panel Members:**

Gil Rice (New Relic),
Dave Josephson (Librato),
Boris Livshutz (Akamai)
