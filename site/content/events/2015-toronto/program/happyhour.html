<h3>Happy Hour</h3>

<p>Stick around after our first day close for an exciting evening of food, drinks, music, conversation and gaming at Glenn Gould Studio. Mix
	around in the reception area or join a game of Werewolves, Poker, Catan, Clue, Cards/DevOps Against Humanity, Release or anything else 
	you'd like to play. We'll have a few games but we're hoping you'll bring more. There will be a place at the venue to store games 
	during the day and overnight.</p>
