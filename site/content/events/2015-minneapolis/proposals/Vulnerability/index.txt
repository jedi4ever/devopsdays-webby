**Abstract:**

With learning and empathy being critical tenants of a healthy DevOp environment, you need to be vulnerable.   Being vulnerable allow you to show that you are not perfect, and the rest of your team will feel safe to share successes and failures more freely.  This attitude needs to flow to your whole life.
