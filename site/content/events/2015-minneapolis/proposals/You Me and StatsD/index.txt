title: "You, Me & StatsD"
---

**Abstract:**

"Maybe we have too many metrics" ~ said nobody.

Biz team wants revenue. Devs want key method call times. Ops want response times and throughput.

We ALL want metrics, but instrumenting, viewing and monitoring these metrics normally involves a stack of tools, tons of coordination and worries about overhead.

Until now.

Let's spend 5 minutes and explore StatsD, an open-sourced network daemon that listens, collects and aggregates statistics for backend services. We'll take a quick look at what StatsD can collect, what a typical StatsD stack looks like - and a little bit about how teams can leverage StatsD to instrument (all the things).

Walk away with a great head start on a technology you've heard a lot about - but haven't had the chance to explore.
