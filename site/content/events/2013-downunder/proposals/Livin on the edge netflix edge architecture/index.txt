title: "Livin on the edge: netflix edge architecture"
---

**Abstract:**

Life on the edge is innovating a system that is ultimately responsible
for 1/3 of all internet bandwidth usage in the US.  Even wonder how
Netflix does it?  This talk will overview a combination of services
and open source projects that comprise the edge network, including
Netflix Denominator.  Discussions will include how we deal with DNS,
distributed load balancing as well discovery of mid-tier services.
You'll understand which service components are involved with edge
traffic management.  When you leave, you'll have enough context to
create your own life on the Edge with NetflixOSS!
