title: "Erlang for when you absolutely positively have to keep it running"
---

**Abstract:**

Erlang is really not that terrifying. It is often pimped for its
concurrency features but it was really build for availability.
Multiple lightweight processes, supervision trees, per process heaps
and hot reloading mean you can build highly available fault tolerant
systems. Surprisingly erlang is quite lightweight memory wise - a very
small footprint making it a great tool for supervisory agents and
automation (escript makes it easy to script with it as well).
