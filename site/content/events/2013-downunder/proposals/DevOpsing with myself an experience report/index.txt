title: "DevOpsing with myself: an experience report"
---

**Abstract:**

What happens when you take an experienced systems administrator, build manager, and card-carrying DevOps guy, and drop them on their own into a project where there's no unit testing, infrastructure automation, or architecture?

This happened to Julian Simpson recently, and he's still fixing stuff.  How did it work out?  What did he learn?  Will he be getting PagerDuty alerts during his talk?

A retrospective will be had, on stage.

**Speaker:**
Julian Simpson
