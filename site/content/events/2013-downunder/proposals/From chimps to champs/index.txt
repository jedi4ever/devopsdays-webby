**Abstract:**

Leaving the Ops dungeon and living in the wild with other parts of the business can be a bit scary, is it worth it? Embedding operations engineers in delivery teams creates a really powerful combination that makes those teams crossunctional and helps to close the loop between ops and devs
I would like to share a few stories about this journey and some implications in the process of the evolution in the relationship in different teams where we have tried this approach.
