title: "Service-oriented architectures: A DevOps Dream Come True"
---

**Abstract:**

Automation is fun.  But dealing with the myriad of services that are in the
typical company that has been around for a while (can you say "legacy
systems" without panicking?) tends to put a crimp in your style.  To add
insult to injury, automating everything can *reduce* your ability to clean
out the cruft because so many more things need to be changed in order to
retire a legacy system.

Enter: the service-oriented architecture.  Coming off the back of a
year-long effort to put APIs in front of *everything*, Anchor CTO Matt
Palmer will describe why Anchor decided to do all this work, what worked
well, what didn't work, the benefits we've seen since the introduction of
our new architecture, and how you can make a service-oriented utopia in your
own company.

**Speaker:**
Matt Palmer
