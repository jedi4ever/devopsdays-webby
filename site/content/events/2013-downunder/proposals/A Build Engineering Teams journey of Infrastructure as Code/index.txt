title: "A Build Engineering Team's journey of Infrastructure as Code"
---

**Abstract:**

What does it mean to be practising Infrastructure as Code? Can we tick
that checkbox when we use puppet and have the code checked into SCM?
This talk will cover the kaizen journey of a Build Engineering team
that started with that, and have slowly taken traditional development
practises (such as DVCS, pairing, code reviews, BDD, continuous
integration, continuous delivery) and combined them with traditional
DevOps tools (such as puppet, mcollective, veewee, vagrant,
librarian-puppet, puppet-lint) and practises (automation, provisioning
from scratch, cattle instead of pets mentality) in managing a largish
build platform (20 physical machines, 260 VMs, and 300 EC2 instances,
Linux & Windows) that is critical to Atlassian's ability to deliver
software to their customers. With the use of traditional development
practises, come with development team related challenges, such as slow
local development feedback loop, slow CI, flakey tests, ineffective
code reviews, large infrequent releases causing large failures. You'll
discover the tools & practises that worked for the team in managing
this build platform, what challenges that were faced and how they were
resolved.
