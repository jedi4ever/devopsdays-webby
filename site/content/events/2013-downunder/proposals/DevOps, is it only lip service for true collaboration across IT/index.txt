title: "DevOps, is it only lip service for true collaboration across IT?"
---

**Abstract:**

DevOps has taken IT by storm and is very likely on track to become ubiquitous. But are we truly embracing a collaborative mindset and a notion of IT "working as one"? Or are we simply paying lip service to the idea of breaking down silos? I want to challenge the audience to examine their understanding of the DevOps approach and challenge every individual to build connections and networks with someone new in their IT organisation, today.
