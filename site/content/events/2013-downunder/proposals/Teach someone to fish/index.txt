title: "Teach someone to fish ..."
---

**Abstract:**

It used to be the case that I sought to engineer myself out of a job ... but in this day and age, that's becoming harder to do.

I reckon we should be helping others to engineer ourselves out of jobs (and trying to engineer each other out of a job as well). I have some thoughts and suggestions on how to achieve this in a nicely DevOps way.

Perhaps we can help each other learn how to fish ...
