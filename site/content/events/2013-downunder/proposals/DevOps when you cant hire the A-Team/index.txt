title: "DevOps when you can't hire the A-Team"
---

**Abstract:**

Presented this as an open mike ignite at DevOpsDays Austin.  Had good feedback from Gene Kim and Byron Miller, refined a bit would like to submit it for DevOpsDays Downunder.

The DevOps movement, DevOpsDays especially is attended by the 1%, the people traditional companies wish they could hire.  In this session I go over a typical 1% approach to DevOps and why it risks condeming DevOps to be a niche way of working due to elitist, roll your own approaches that won't scale.

**Speaker:**
Jonathan Thorpe
