title: "MYOB: From no ops to devops in 12 easy months"
---

**Abstract:**

The content of this presentation is an exposition of how a devops team came to be created at MYOB Accountants Division a year ago in June 2012, what the team has achieved, what the team hopes to achieve in the future, and the lessons to be learnt.
 
This presentation will be interesting because it touches upon:

-	How to convince management that a devops team is required.   [Took a while to convince my immediate boss]
- How to get a devops team started up.    [What I did to kick off the team]
- How to convince management that a devops team gives on-going value.    [My boss’s boss was not convinced]
- Is devops only for online software only or can it be applied to desktop software as well?    [The essence of devops applies equally I believe]
- How to leverage devops to add value to the business.    [How the team came to the attention of the business beyond PD]
- How does devops differ in for a software vendor vs enterprise software?   [Should become apparent during course of talk]
- How important is tool selection?    [We spent almost time on this – was that wise?]
