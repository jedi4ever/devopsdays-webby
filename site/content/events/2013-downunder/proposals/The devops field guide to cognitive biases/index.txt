title: "The devops field guide to cognitive biases"
---

**Abstract:**

As devops practitioners we focus on improving the culture of
collaboration so that others play nicely with us & we play nicely with
others - but what if the biggest thing holding us back from change is
our own brains?

Cognitive biases can deeply affect our behaviours towards others by
herding us towards mental shortcuts that are optimised for timeliness
over accuracy, at the expense of rationalising irrational behaviour.

You are probably pushing these biases onto other people every day but
don't even know it. Does that idea make you feel unconfortable? You
are probably experiencing the Semmelweis reflex kicking your
confirmation bias right now.

Knowing is half the battle. This talk will delve into some of the
well-known and less well-known biases that may be affecting your
ability to work with your peers, and your team's ability to work
constructively with other teams.

Attendees will leave the talk with an overview of biases they run into
every day, how to hack their brains to use these biases to their
advantage, and some tips on how to mitigate the effects of the
limitations baked into their wetware.

We have met the enemy and he is us.
