**Abstract:**

An effective operations team is ready to react quickly and decisively
when systems fail.  We all know they will fail.

How do you maintain those ops muscles in prime condition when an
infrastructure is basically stable?  We know muscles atrophy when not
used regularly.  Failures and disasters can be simulated to give
operations teams this much needed practice.  Netflix have their simian
army to inject some chaos into their infrastructure.  Amazon, Etsy and
others have firedrills and game days of different kinds.

We have a framework for running incident firedrills at whole new level
using ideas borrowed from D&D.

Instead of a band of elves and humans fighting orcs and trolls we have
a campaign of sysadmins, DBAs, network and security engineers fighting
cascading system failures, database corruption and increased latency
in 3rd party APIs.  Complex campaign scenarios are planned out by one
of the team acting as "Dungeon Master".

By running these regularly we can roleplay leadership and
communication within the team, distribute knowledge, train up new
staff to go on-call, and even expose developers to the dangerous and
exciting world of operations.
