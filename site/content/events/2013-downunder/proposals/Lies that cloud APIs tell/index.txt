title: "Lies that cloud APIs tell"
---

**Abstract:**

Amazon, rackspace and other top tier cloud hosting providers have
quite comprehensive apis, however these apis have a far lower QoS than
their hosting services, are eventually consistent (inconsistent?) in
many places, and can be generally very very hard to work with if you
get too carried away building on them. I got too carried away using
them, and thought other people would like to hear about this (having
said that, they are an excellent tool, but there are trick and traps
to avoid so your application works well)

**Speaker:**
