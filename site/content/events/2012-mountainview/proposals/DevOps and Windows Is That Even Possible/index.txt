title: "DevOps and Windows: Is That Even Possible?"
---
**Abstract:** 

The notion of DevOps is well accepted in the Linux and open-source world.  In the Windows space and for Windows admins DevOps seems like a foreign concept.  Windows admins in large deployment shops typically have a different view point than Linux admins.  Accordingly, Linux admins are unaware of the state of Windows at scale.  This presentation will focus how DevOps can be approached in a large-scale Windows-based deployment, how to overcome the Windows admin ""mindset"" with regard to operations and dev ops.  This proposal offers a strong curiosity factor while at the same time opens the philosophy further into the Windows community.

**Speaker:** Dan Gilmer, Senior Ops Engineer at Ancestry
