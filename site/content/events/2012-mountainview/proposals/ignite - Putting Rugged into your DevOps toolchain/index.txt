title: "Putting Rugged into your DevOps toolchain"
---
**Abstract:** 

Security is part of DevOps however security tools are inadequate for putting into your continuous deploy and integration toolchain.  Rugged (ruggedsoftware.org) is a new holistic approach on security where secure code is defined as code that is resilient, scalable, and long-running.  This talk will discuss various approaches to achieving ruggedness using tools like cucumber and gauntlt (https://github.com/thegauntlet/gauntlt) and some ideas on how to get started implementing Rugged into your DevOps toolchain.

**Proposer:** James Wickett
