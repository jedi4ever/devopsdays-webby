title: "Stop flying blind! (i.e. Why monitoring is no longer an option.)"
---
**Abstract:** 

In the 21st century successful teams are data-driven. This talk begins with an introduction to why monitoring in near-real time is now a "must-have" in DevOps to enable continuous deployment i.e. "Monitoring is to DevOps as Unit Tests are to Development". Weâ€™ll then present an abstract model of a complete monitoring system broken down into it's fundamental components (e.g. collection, aggregation, common storage, visualization, alerting) and discuss multiple solutions (OSS and services) for each component. Explains the primary motivations/benefits of building a common monitoring infrastructure such arbitrary correlation/analysis of metrics across your all levels of your stack and systematic alerting/escalation. Examines how dashboards service multiple purposes such as: 

* aberration detection
* radiate information in a common format to the entire team
* encapsulate best practices for initial fire-fighting triage.

**Speaker:** Joseph Ruscio, Co-Founder and CTO at Librato, Inc
