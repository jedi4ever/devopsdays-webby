title: "Cultural Change and DevOps"
---
**Abstract:** 

There are a number of tools & practices that support DevOps, but an organization's long term success is often bounded by cultural constraints.  I'll describe techniques for assessing an organization's cultural supportiveness of DevOPs and share approaches for influencing positive cultural change. Organizations have two major dimensions that determine if change takes hold: the driving force—top-down versus bottom-up — and the constituent focus — externally oriented versus internally oriented. I'll discusses specific tactics you can use to increase the success of DevOps for different organization types and with consideration for different levels of authority within organizations. I'll also give pragmatic advice from the field about what's worked and what hasn't.
