title: "WinDevops: Devops tooling and automation in Windows environments"
---
**Abstract:** 

Most Devops tooling so far has focused on Unix environments, which through SSH have powerful support for remote execution. On Windows the situation is a little bit more complicated, with interactive protocols like RDP long having been the ""standard"" method for remoting.
In this presentation we will review some of the technologies available for remote execution on Windows, discuss how they play with well-known Devops tools such as Puppet and Vagrant, and examine Overthere, a new open-source JVM library for unified, agentless remote file manipulation and process execution on both Windows and Unix.

**Speaker:** Vincent Partington
