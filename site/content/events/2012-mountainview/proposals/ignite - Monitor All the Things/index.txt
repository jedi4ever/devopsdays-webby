**Abstract:** 

At Krux, we run at a pretty high traffic load from multiple sources (we provide infrastructure for big publishers), so we live and die by our monitoring and graphing.

We use some clever tricks to measure everything we can get our hands on and are pushing about 300k metrics per seconds.

I'd like to take 5 minutes and point folks at some of the tricks they could use to make their lives easier.

**Proposer:** Jos Boumans
