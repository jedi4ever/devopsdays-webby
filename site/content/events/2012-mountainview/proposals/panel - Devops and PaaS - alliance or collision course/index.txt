title:  "Panel - Devops and PaaS: alliance or collision course?"
---
*Panel discussion*

Public and, increasingly, private and hybrid Platform as a Service offerings are steadily gaining traction in the market. With current PaaS providers saying: "Why would you want to do all the boring work of managing and scaling your infrastructure? Let us solve that problem for you!", how could Devops teams leverage such platforms?

Some questions the panel/discussion could consider:

* Will PaaS simply not make it in an enterprise context?
* Does it make more sense from a Devops perspective to build and manage a private PaaS on top of an IaaS platform or private cloud, using technologies such as CloudStack, OpenStack or VMware?
* Will a second generation of PaaS platforms or stacks such as Brooklyn appear that give Devops more influence over configuration, scaling etc.?
