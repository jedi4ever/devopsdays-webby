title: "Deploying Software to the Cloud"

**Abstract:** 

Evolution of Salesforce.com:

Web App ->  Service -> Platform -> Cloud

Web App to Web Service

* Ad-Hoc nature of our initial deployments.
* Go with what you know. Or whatever is lying around.
* Releasing code using a Version Control System
* Linear vs Distributed Version Control Systems
* Problems scaling VCS-based deployments with a centralized, linear VCS
* Inherent overhead of a VCS
  * Perforce
  * Git

Becoming a Platform:

* Weird math: 3 Releases a year == 500 Releases a year
* Feeling the strain of success.

In the Cloud:

* Approaching Zero Downtime deployments.
* Trust is No. 1
* Innovation at Scale
* Moving beyond the VCS:
  * Packages, bundles artifacts...
  * Simple, stupid versioning.
  * Dependencies.
  * Moving away from VCS/Perforce...
  * ...without breaking anything.
  * Migration vs. Disruption  
  * HTTP and REST

Getting faster in the future: 

* BitTorrent and beyond...

What kind of team does it take:

* First class problems require first class engineers.
* *Real* DevOps is a must.
