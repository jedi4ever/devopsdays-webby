title: "Getting Devs to Own Their Ops"
---

**Abstract:**

Fabian Iannarella and Karl Chu will give an overview about the self-serve infrastructure system that the team at IOOF is building to enable, encourage, and enforce development teams to own the ops of their application. They will describe where IOOF was a year ago, the challenges the team was facing, how some of those challenges were addressed, and the current state of the solution. Fabian and Karl will also delve slightly into IOOF's implementation of role-based Puppet deployment that transfers complete ownership of the infrastructure code to the development team.
