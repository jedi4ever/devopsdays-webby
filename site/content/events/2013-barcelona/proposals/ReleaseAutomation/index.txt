title: "Release Automation – all the fundamentals you need to know"
---
**Abstract:**

The process of automating the deployment of an application from development, to testing,  and then  to production,  stretches across vastly different IT environments.  Automating the release deployment process is a prerequisite for any organization moving towards continuous delivery and automated release promotion along the SDLC, and a potential cornerstone of any DevOps initiative.

But what does Release Automation actually mean for release, deployment, change and application delivery teams, operations, production and the business as a whole? 
Both development and IT operations teams urgently need a solution to effectively streamline application release deployments -  to deliver quality applications faster and meet growing business needs.
* How exactly does it work? 
* What does it do and equally importantly, what doesn’t it do? 
* What impact can it make on release cycles, where and how? 
* Which organizations have adopted this? 
* What benefits are they seeing? 
* Can they really shorten cycles from months or weeks to days or minutes? 
* What is an application delivery maturity model – and where are you currently on this?

This session gives you all the essentials and explains how Release Automation can complement your existing automation technologies.
