title: An introduction to Disciplined Agile Delivery
---

**Abstract:**

A framework aimed to cover the gap between single agile teams (scrum+something is enough) and traditional IT shops (Prince2/PMBOK/CMMI/ITIL...).

One of the big values of DAD is that is "enterprise enabled" meaning that its proposed lifecycle, goals and roles can be understood and accepted by a medium-to-big IT department. If we consider the change management issues we could find in transitioning such IT departments to DevOps then DAD becomes of a great help.

In short, the presentation would talk about:
* Defining Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD)
* Hybrid framework
* Lifecycles
* Roles
* Process goal driven
* Enterprise awareness
* Scaling and tailoring
* Governance

What about DAD and DevOps?

* What is the role of QA/Tester in devops
* How do we integrate QA in the continuous delivery process
* The impact devops has on traditional security/auditing/change control
* How does devops co-exist with ITIL, Cobit
* How about release management ?
* Help prove that devops can scale beyond the 5-8 person web startups, we love traditional IT enterprise cases
With all the automation, data is still a hard thing to handle, how does it affect, DBA's, backup strategies, ...
* How to involve the business in devops
* How to get YOUR boss involved, how do you make the business case
