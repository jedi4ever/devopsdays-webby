title: "Application deployments using Linux containers Vagrant & Docker"
---
**Abstract:**

## Description or abstract

The problem(s) of fully bloated Virtual Machines:

* Consume another layer of system memory.
* IO is slower than the actual real system and makes the aplication sluggish to respond.
* Are very complex to configure.
* The application needs faster automated deployments solutions.
* Costumers need full shell access, with services admin.

## The proposed solution:

LXC is a lightweight virtualization method that provides operating system-level virtualization optional to an heavy full virtual machine. It relies on the Linux kernel cgroups functionality that became available in version 2.6.24, It provides a virtual environment that has its own process and network space. This option makes the perfect option for deploying several contained Drupal dev environments independent of the distribution.
Docker is a solution from dotCloud, which simplifies and improves the process of creating and managing Linux containers.
Vagrant 1.1+ lxc plugin allows it to control and provision Linux Containers as an alternative to the built in (and heavy) Vagrant VirtualBox provider for Linux hosts.
