title: Breaking Organizational Barriers - A Sweaty Use Case
---

**Abstract:**

You Thought Implementing Devops Is Hard? Try Building a Shower in Your Workplace.

This ignite is about hacking organizational culture, and how a seemingly impossible venture (building a fully functional shower in a place where there is no room or budget for it) can be made possible with a few simple (but determined) steps.

It all started when I wanted to encourage people (including myself) to ride their bicycle to work, but needed a place to wash off our sweat after the intensive morning rides. By using this funny use case I’ll demonstrate a few tricks I used that are very relevant to driving change in any organization.
