I will speak of the Past, Present and Future of Performance Engineering within devops. It is interesting as it is one of the requirements from the market to be competitive. Performance is really important in marketing trends and it is a task that depends not only in developers and QA but as well it relies in the  system,  perfectly fitting DevOps tasks.
