**Abstract:**

"I told you to do that, but instead you went ahead and ...", calm down.

I'm gonna speak about my experience as both a dev and ops, and the challenges I've faced with the other side, while being on both sides.
Mainly on how neither know how to deliver to each other, or even better, how to understand what the others want. With concrete examples on what to do based on which side of the fence you are.

**Speaker:**
Andrei Serdeliuc
