title: "Even a classical retail company can go DevOpsâ€¦ With success"
---
**Abstract:**

The aim is to explain the long and difficult way done in a classical and quite normal IT department in a classical company towards the DevOps philosophy. We would like to present in a few slides:
* why we MUST go to DevOps (from a technical and organizational point of view)
* What we practiced as technics and different improvements
* Which learning way we used, based on agile practices,
* The effort done by the people to destroy existing communication and collaboration barriers
* What we would like to reach as level in the next months / years

**Speaker:**
Sylvain Loubradou
