title: "Implementing Change"

**Abstract**

Like with any other change, bringing the DevOps culture into an existing organization is hard. In all likelihood you will face a lot of resistance when trying to alter existing procedures, modify rigid roles people play on their teams and allocate budget and time to learning new tools and implementing new solutions.

What, or rather who, are your main obstacles?
Who is your "client" or the main beneficiary of the change?
What are the principal steps you need to take to move "per aspera ad astra"?
