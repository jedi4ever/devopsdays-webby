## Code of Conduct
Inclusiveness and respect for differences are core devops values, and we invite you to help us make each DevopsDays conference a place that is welcoming and respectful to all participants. Attendees that are acting in a manner not consistent with these values may be asked to leave the conference without a refund at the sole discretion of the conference organizers.
