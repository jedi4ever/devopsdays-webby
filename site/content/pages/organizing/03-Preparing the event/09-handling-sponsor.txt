title: Finding/Handling Sponsors
---
Sponsors pay the bill. You rely on them. So what can you do to find them and keep them satified:

- post the event on the devopsdays google group. We informed previous sponsors to subscribe themselves to get information on new events. 
- post on the twitters , facebook, find local meetups/companies that can help you
- if you're looking for a contact of a specific company that sponsored before, ping the devopsdays core-organizers to see if they can help.
- write a blog on the website to expose the event.

Sponsors will usually ask you the following, best to have that information ready (in a PDF mailable form).

- Number of Attendees
- Background of Attendees (C-level, Developer, Manager) - we usually refer to the registration page for that
- What they get with what level of sponsorship (refer to the sponsor page)
- If they can buy a speaker spot (NO , but they can submit a talk, ignite or openspace topic)
- If they have electricity & network at the venue
- If they can get a monitor (let them bring their own)
- Where to ship their stuff and pick it up (don't take responsibility and let them handle that directly with venue)
- What size of table they have? Find out with the venue and say it has to fit behind the one table
- If you provide a scanning mechanism (no we don't go that route)

From experience, we found that it helps to have single contact with the sponsor that tracks prospect, payment, discount codes attendees.

When they sponsor they need to supply:
- a logo for on the website and printed program
- a URL to link it to
- a responsible email address
- the invoice details (including VAT in Europe)

In return you'll :

- put the logo online
- link it on the website
- send the official invoice
- once payment has been receive provide a discount code

On the registration page make them select the special sponsor ticket with their discount.
Many of the sponsor contact are traveling from event to event, you'll have to sheppard them a bit so they sign up their crew in time.
