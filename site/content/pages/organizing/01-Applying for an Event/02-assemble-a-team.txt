In the devops spirit of collaboration, find people in your region that want to help you run the next awesome event. Finding friends is easier then you think:

- post your interest on the DevopsDays or local mailinglists
- send out a tweet that you'd be interested in running one in your region (use #devopsdays hash tag, we'll pick it up)
- send a mail to us [info AT devopsdays DOT org](mailto:info@devopsdays.org) and we'll try to connect you to other people in your region

You see, that was easy. This has been the start of many of the events, and the magic works nice everytime, believe us.
