title: Setting up Registration
---
Once pricing has been decided you're ready to setup registration. We've had good experiences with <http://www.eventbrite.com> integrated with <http://paypal.com> payments. 
The paypal account for payment needs to be linked directly to the company that does the invoicing.

We as the DevopsDays organization can create the event for you and give you administrative access. This allows us to track people from the website and do email communication in the future.
But you can also set it up yourself and allow us access:
- so we can see the people registered
- the registration details
- that we can export contact details for later

Specifically on eventbrite we do:

- ask for the company name and job title (useful to attract other people to the event)
- ask for T-shirt sizes
- ask if they require an invoice, if yes ask more details like VAT number if needed
- ask if there are interested in an evening event meetup
- We usually disable the facebook integration
- allow people to see who is coming (name, company , title)
- add the google analytics tag of DevopsDays for counting hits

- setup a sponsor/helper/ ticket which has a high price ($9999)
- create discount codes for sponsors/helpers/organizes and have them select the special ticket to can keep track of regular attendees and sponsors/helpers/speakers free tickets.
- the main reason is that when the event is full, you still might to register the sponsor/helper/speaker people.

The email or direct-contact information should never be visible on the website or given out to vendors. We value privacy and anti-spam a lot!
