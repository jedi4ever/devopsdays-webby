If we have all the above going, we're ready to announce your event to the world and we'll setup the event on the website and mailinglist:

__Mailing-lists:__

- we will create an official organizers, proposals, info email address from the DevopsDays event (ex. organizers-yourlocation-year@devopsdays.org)
- all devopsdays core organizers will receive all mails from this mailinglist

- Announcements can be made to the official [DevopsDays googlegroup](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/devopsdays)

__Website:__

- we will setup an event space on the website (we take fork requests via <https://github.com/jedi4ever/devopsdays-webby>)

__Twitter:__

- Unfortuneatly we can't share the twitter credentials easily. But we'll happily retweet stuff.
- Use hashtag __#devopsdays__ for promoting the event. This allows for maximum exposure
