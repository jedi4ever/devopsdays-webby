You got friends, and you have a date (no, not that kind of date) , what's next? You guessed it, the perfect venue!  If you can take this hurdle, you're 80% there! gogo!

Let's first see what we need from a venue from a space point:

- A (big) room where everybody can sit comfortable and listen to the talks. This of course depends on the number of attendees you expect. We can have done events with a minimum of 70 people - 400 people
- A number of break-out rooms for the afternoon sessions:
  - being able to put the chairs in a circle for better discussion
  - you can be creative by splitting the big room in smaller rooms but in practice it works out less
  - we usually go for a few smaller (10-20) and few bigger (20-40) rooms
  - you can still use the big room for sessions too
- Room to hangout: not everybody attends sessions, and just want to hang around. If there is some room for the food, or a creative room that's a plus.
- Sponsor space: Gold sponsors usually get a table to have presence. Make sure they have a nice spot at the event (typically close to the food or hangout space)

Besides having enough space, there are other things to consider:

- is the venue easily reachable by public transport
- is there (affordable) hotel accomodation nearby (doing it in a hotel makes it easy for foreign guests)
- does the venue allow for catering by other parties, or what are the options for food
- has the conference enough wifi/internet capacity: some people might have to do some work, or are on call.
- can the video be streamed with enough capacity (if livestreaming is an option)

A final big space differentiator is the pricing: as the prices of a DevopsDays range from free to pretty low, we can't afford to pay the big bucks there.
We got around this in the past by:

- lookout for (free) innovation centres, education venues (universities...)
- find local companies that can act as a host with their facilities
- find a host sponsor that is willing to pay a venue for you

Don't overcommit on the number of people coming and don't do a pre-payment for the venue yet. Do this when the event gets more body and you've processed a few more steps. The same goes for food: it's always easier to add a few extra plates as opposed to having too many food ordered.

Pfewww, if you can pull this off, you're ready for eternal fame! AND we will burry you with compliments saying how awesome you are!
It's a good idea by now to appoint a 'venue' liason officer that will take care of any logistics onsite.
