title: How to pay us back
---
We expect the following in return:

- recorded video and slides content needs to flow back to the DevopsDays website. This helps in building a central place for reference
- core-organizers get free access to the event
- we are involved in the selection process of the talks
- platinum sponsors get access to the event
- sponsoring runs through the central DevopsDays organisation
- we appreciate money left from 'local' sponsorship. But all the sponsor money is there for your event. We're not planning to get rich on these.
