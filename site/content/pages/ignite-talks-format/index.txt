title: Devopsdays - ignite talks format
---

If you have a strong devops related message that you really want to share with the DevOps world, we encourage you to send us a proposal for an Ignite presentation. 

These are 5 minute talks with 20 slides which auto-advance. If you aren't familiar with the format, google is your friend (and I won't question your geek cred... *cough* maybe you've just been busy... go check some out, we'll still be here when you get back. ) Ignite is a fun way to introduce people to ideas and leave them wanting more. 

Good examples can be found at [http://igniteshow.com/](http://igniteshow.com)

We have 10 slots scheduled right now and half of those are filled, so you still have a good chance to share your ideas. Tell us about tools, processes, tips, tricks, war stories, whatever... make us laugh, make us cry, show us how to be more awesome... 

The only rule is don't give a straight pitch. That's not even a rule we'll enforce, everyone will just think you are lame... that is punishment enough.
